That meant that Delaware had the same political weight as Virginia, even though Virginia had more than twelve times the population as Delaware. All the states had ratified the Articles—so they had all agreed to the terms—but the equality of suffrage in Congress had rankled the large states from the start. Most of the delegates from the large states, and even some from the medium- and small-sized states, arrived at the Convention with the intention to “fix” that imbalance when they revised the Articles. James Madison explained in a letter to Virginia’s governor, Edmund Randolph, that the equality of the states under the old Articles, “if not just towards the larger members of it, is at least safe to them” (emphasis added). He believed that the Articles were safe for the larger states because its government was so weak and ineffectual that any state was able to resist any measure it didn’t like. If the upcoming Convention succeeded in drafting a Constitution that created a stronger government, however, then Madison believed that it would also have to represent the states in a way that treated the larger ones with more justice.  \t  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_988","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_988","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1231","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1231","title":"State Representation in the House of Representatives ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1002","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1002","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1232","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1232","title":"Individual Representation in the Senate ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1003","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1003","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1005","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1005","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1009","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1009","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_765","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_765","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_766","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_766","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide52318","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"A Question of Justice","thumbnail":"dr/Slide52318_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si68526","si68528","Text_Caption_1162","Image_988","Text_Caption_1231","Image_1002","Text_Caption_1232","Image_1003","Image_1005","Image_1009"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide52318"}}},{"id":"si68589","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si68591","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_365","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_365","title":"The Great Compromise ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_236","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_236","title":"A Question of Justice ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1163","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1163","title":"Contemporary Perspectives ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1164","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1164","title":"When histories are written about the arguments that led to the “Great Compromise,” it is commonplace for them to emphasize that each state was arguing on behalf of its own self-interest. The large states wanted Congress to be represented proportionally, because doing so would enhance their power in the new government. The small states wanted Congress to represent the states equally, because that arrangement would magnify their own political clout. This interpretation is not incorrect, but it is incomplete. Political positions can be spurred by self-interest or self-righteousness, and the one motivation does not necessarily cancel out the other.   This mixture of self-interest and moral principle seems apparent when the Framers argued about representation in the new Congress, and that is why their arguments became so inflamed. Most delegates argued for the position that they thought would benefit their own state, but they also argued on behalf of what they thought was rightfully their due. In order to understand their arguments, then, it is necessary to understand these different perspectives of justice from which the Framers argued.

Some questions are generally agreed to be a matter of simple equality. For instance, the rule of “one man, one vote” supposes that, since we are all equal in our political rights, it is right that every person’s vote should have equal weight with every other person’s vote, regardless of the wealth, status, or education of the individuals in a community. Other questions, such as levying taxes, are better settled proportionally. People may disagree about which rule of proportionality should be applied to taxes—should it be a graduated proportional tax or a “flat” tax? And should the percentage be applied to a person’s income or to purchases (to say nothing of capital gains and inheritance taxes)? But no one argues  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1169","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1169","title":"that a rule of equality should be applied to taxation. And finally, justice is also expressed as a rule of law-abidingness. Put simply, this last rule insists that promises should be kept, contracts should be upheld, and laws should be obeyed. Of course, some contracts are unfair and some laws are unjust, but these exceptions do not disprove the rule. The possibility of unjust laws only means that this last principle of justice will sometimes be in conflict with the other two; and when that conflict is too egregious to be borne, people will clamor that a law must be changed.  The arguments over apportioning seats in Congress involved all three competing notions of justice—equality, proportionality, and law-abidingness—but they also involved competing interpretation of the facts. Part of the reason why the delegates found it difficult to agree over which principle of justice to apply in this case was because they hadn’t yet agreed on what kind of constitution they were creating. Would their government be national or federal? The answer to that question would alter the rule that ought to be applied.

But the Southern states often tended to vote as a coalition, and they no doubt saw proportional representation as more beneficial to the Southern states, taken as a voting bloc, than equality among the states. John Lansing, on the other hand, argued for an equality in the Congress, even though a proportional rule would have benefited his home state of New York. His position was unquestionably adopted because he favored retaining the federal system that had been adopted under the Articles, and he resisted every attempt at consolidating the states into one national government.

For instance, it granted broad, indefinite powers to the central government; it granted Congress a veto over state laws; and it altered the way that legislators were elected. Under the Articles, Congressmen had been chosen by their respective state legislatures. Under the Virginia Plan, members of the first branch would have been elected by the people directly, and members of the second branch would have been nominated by the state legislatures and elected by the members of the first branch. These changes would have ensured that individual lawmakers would be more independent and less beholden to the interests of state legislatures. For many of the delegates from the large states, these two features—nationalism in the central government and proportionality in the way that Congress was apportioned—went together, and the first made the second an even more important principle of justice.

So each man is naturally a sovereign over himself, and all men are therefore naturally equal.  According to Wilson, the principle of proportionality, as applied to the present case, was based in the fact of equality. All people are naturally equal in their self-sovereignty, which is why people have equal political rights.

John Rutledge, from the wealthy but medium-sized state of South Carolina, proposed that the rule of proportionality should be based on the taxes that each state paid into the national treasury: “The justice of this rule, he said, could not be contested.” But the position of some of the Southern delegates on this issue is muddied by their wish to include slaves in the rule of representation. By basing representation on taxation, Southerners would indirectly augment their representation beyond their free population (since taxation would be based on wealth, and slaves would be a part of any accounting of wealth).

Elbridge Gerry insisted that, even though he was among those who had originally agreed to the Articles of Confederation, “the injustice of allowing each state an equal vote was long insisted on.” And Rufus King contended that the equality desired by the small states would result in a government “which must be as short-lived as it would be unjust,” and he was convinced that “no government would last that was not founded on just principles.” The members from South Carolina were likewise united on this point. Pierce Butler was convinced that they could not represent either house on the basis of equality, because Americans would never “adopt a plan evidently unjust.” And Charles Pinckney agreed that “the number of inhabitants appeared to him the only just and practicable rule.” Madison emphasized the justice of this question more than anyone. He referred to proportional representation “as a fundamental principle of just government”; he called on “the small states to renounce a principle which was confessedly unjust”; and he protested that it was unreasonable that the large states were being asked to depart “from justice in order to conciliate the smaller slates.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_733","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_733","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_734","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_734","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1018","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1018","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1019","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1019","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide69090","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Justice By Proportionality","thumbnail":"dr/Slide69090_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si69182","si69184","Text_Caption_1181","Text_Caption_1182","Image_1018","Image_1019"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide69090"}}},{"id":"si69289","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_372","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_372","title":"The Great Compromise ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_243","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_243","title":"Justice By Equality ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1186","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1186","title":"This perspective of justice, however, was by no means shared amongst the whole assembly.

According to Yates’ notes of the debates, William Paterson objected that Wilson’s explanation—that proportionality was based on the political equality of all men—“is right in principle, but unfortunately for him, wrong in the application to the question now in debate.” If they were creating a simple national government, then the equality of all men would be relevant, but they were creating a confederacy: “A confederacy supposes sovereignty in the members  composing it, and sovereignty supposes equality.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1187","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1187","title":"According to the proponents of equal representation, the equality among the states was not only necessary for protecting the interests of the small states, but to protect all of the state governments from being swallowed by the national government.

Instead, “the states, like individuals, were, in a state of nature, equally sovereign and free”; therefore, these sovereign states should be granted equal representation in Congress.

The second resolution specified “that the rights of suffrage in the National Legislature ought to be proportioned to the Quotas of contribution, or to the number of free inhabitants, as the one or the other rule may seem best in different cases.” The attention of the delegates was focused like a laser on the question of the relative political importance of each state.   Both sides in this epic contest had surveyed the field in advance of the battle and strategized over the best way to come out victorious. According to Madison’s records, Pennsylvania’s delegates had wanted to introduce proportional suffrage into the voting within the Constitutional Convention. If the large states were given their proportional weight when framing the Constitution, then they could easily outvote the small states on this and other questions. The Pennsylvanians felt certain that the small states could be forced into accepting this change, but the Virginians convinced them that they should not risk creating a hostile environment from the outset. If the small states were humiliated and bullied before they had even established the rules for the Convention, they may never come around to see the reasonableness of changing the method of apportionment in the Constitution. Instead, Virginia’s strategy was to arrive on the scene with a plan that established a change in representation (the Virginia Plan), and all the large states could coalesce around this plan. Consequently, the Convention retained the same one-state, one-vote rule that operated in the Confederation Congress. They hoped (optimistically) that with this magnanimous gesture the small states would eventually be persuaded, “in the course of the deliberations, to give up their equality for the sake of an effective government.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_739","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_739","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_740","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_740","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1017","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1017","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide69410","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Political Maneuvers Leading up to the \"Great Compromise\"","thumbnail":"dr/Slide69410_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si69444","si69446","Text_Caption_1191","Image_1017"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide69410"}}},{"id":"si69604","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_376","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_376","title":"The Great Compromise ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_247","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_247","title":"Small States on the Defensive ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1194","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1194","title":"Delaware’s Directive ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1195","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1195","title":"The small states had also planted a few tricks up their sleeves.

On May 29, the first day that the Virginia Plan was being discussed in the Committee of the Whole, the large states tried to establish the principle of a proportional rule of suffrage in the new Congress. Madison reported (optimistically) that the proposed change was “generally relished” and “would have been agreed to when . . .” their momentum was halted by Delaware’s George Read.

This dramatic standoff was the culmination of a little forethought and subterfuge on the part of Delaware, since it was Read himself who had ensured that the prohibition would be included in his state’s credentials. As he explained to his colleague, John Dickinson, months before the Convention: the prohibition “occurred to me, as a prudent measure.” Read feared that their state might find themselves outgunned in the Convention, and that “the argument or oratory of the smaller State commissioners will avail little.” He therefore wished to have more leverage against the large states, and his professed “duty” to abide by his state’s directives was no more than the application of this premeditated strategy.

Benjamin Franklin simply urged delegates to be less obstinate and more yielding in their positions and prefer the common good to their individual advantage.

There was strong support for proportional representation in the first house, but the contest would be focused on how to distribute representation in the second house.

Before the Convention could consider the report by the Committee of the Whole, William Paterson introduced the New Jersey Plan on June 15, which left the federal arrangement little changed from the Articles of Confederation. Most notably, the legislature would retain a single house in which the states would be represented equally. Different states backed this plan for different reasons. New Jersey and Delaware were primarily interested in maintaining the equal representation in Congress. But some individual delegates from Connecticut, New York, and Maryland were set against “a departure from the principle of the Confederation, wishing rather to add a few new powers to Congress than to substitute a national government.” They clearly saw that the shift from equal to proportional representation went hand-in-hand with a shift from a federal to a national government, and they wanted none of it. \t The counter-proposal by Paterson and his cohorts was seen as a direct response to the intransigence of the large states. After the New Jersey Plan was proposed, Dickinson confronted Madison, exclaiming: “You see the consequence of pushing things too far. Some of the members from the small states wish for two branches in the general legislature, and are friends to a good national government; but we would sooner submit to foreign power than submit to be deprived, in both branches of the legislature, of an equality of suffrage, and thereby be thrown under the domination of the larger states.” Madison and his companions were unmoved.

Even among the states that were present, it would only take a few individual defections from Madison’s coalition before the majority shifted in the other direction. And members from both sides began expressing a willingness to compromise.   On June 21—a couple of days after the Convention decided to work from the Virginia Plan rather than the New Jersey Plan—William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut sought some clarification. He said that the main characteristic of New Jersey’s Plan was that it was designed to “preserve the individuality of the states.” The backers of the Virginia Plan, on the other hand, “did not profess to destroy this individuality altogether,” but the Plan’s opponents had accused it of having that tendency nonetheless. It was up to the Virginia Plan’s advocates, then, to prove that the states “should retain some portion of sovereignty at least” under this arrangement, even though it did not give each state “a distinct and equal vote for the purpose of defending themselves in the general councils.” In response, the large states then struggled to provide this proof and reassurance. Wilson pointed out that the Committee of the Whole had unanimously decided that senators should be chosen by the state legislatures. This agency in choosing members of the second branch would give the states, as states, considerable influence in the new government.

It would not, therefore, give to others a power over this happiness, any more than an individual would do, when he could avoid it.” Once again, Johnson stepped forward, on June 29, as the voice of moderation and compromise:  The controversy must be endless whilst gentlemen differ in the grounds of their arguments: those on one side considering the states as districts  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1208","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1208","title":"of people composing one political society, those on the other considering them as so many political societies.

Since the United States would be neither wholly national nor wholly federal, the apportionment of representation in the legislature should, in a corresponding manner, be neither wholly proportional nor wholly equal. Johnson had for the first time expressed clearly the middle ground between the two extreme positions at the Convention, and he had expressed the formulation that would ultimately be used to defend the Constitution. Johnson was attempting to be the voice of reason amid the noisy clamor, but many at the Convention were not yet disposed to be reasonable.

Bedford was not amused at this veiled threat, and issued one of his own. If the large states did dissolve the confederation, “the small ones will find some foreign ally, of more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand, and do them justice.” These words smacked of treason, and many members expressed their outrage.

Nonetheless, he repeated the warning that, in the event of a “breach of faith” on the part of the large states, “no man can foresee to what extremities the small states may be driven by oppression.” Bedford had issued his threat to seek foreign allies on June 30 and issued his apology on July 5. In between, the delegates had taken a day off, in order to celebrate the anniversary of the country’s independence from foreign oppression.  In the midst of this standoff, the large-state bulwark was developing fissures. On July 2, a proposal to give “each state one vote in the second branch” lost on a tied vote. Some members from the large states were forced to admit that the small states had a point. Massachusetts’ Nathaniel Gorham said he was “inclined to a compromise as to the rule of proportion. He thought there was some weight in the objections of the small states.” It was finally decided to refer the whole question of apportionment to a committee consisting of one member from each state.

The report further stipulated that its parts could not be separated; instead, the Convention must vote on the report as an all-or-nothing proposition. Very few members from the large states were appeased by the “concession” of originating revenue bills in the branch that would represent population proportionally. Wilson remarked that, “as to the privilege of originating money bills, it was not considered by any as of much moment, and by many as improper in itself.” Madison later reckoned that, of the five states who had wanted proportional representation in the second branch, “a majority, viz., Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina, have uniformly voted against the proposed compensation, on its own merits, as rendering the plan of government still more objectionable.” After the Committee delivered its report, each side continued to insist on the justice of its respective position—often in the most acrimonious terms—for another eleven days.

The happiness of the people depended on it.” His tar-heel colleague, William Davie, had to admit that “local prejudices and interests” would continue to exist, “whether the representatives should be chosen by the legislatures or by the people themselves.” He began to be persuaded by the compromise position described by Johnson: “We were partly federal, partly national, in our union; and he did not see why the government might not in some respects operate on the states, in others on the people.” Massachusetts’ Elbridge Gerry agreed with his Southern colleague that their confederation was “in a peculiar situation. We were neither the same nation, nor different nations. We ought not, therefore, to pursue the one or the other of these ideas too closely.” And Caleb Strong was among the few who believed that “the small states had made a considerable concession, in the article of money bills, and that they might naturally expect some concessions on the other side.

The majority now believed that the Virginia Plan had formed a government that was too nationalistic. What most of the Framers wanted was a Constitution that reflected their “peculiar situation” as a union that was “partly federal, partly national.” This was the formula that was born out of these debates and the one that was ultimately accepted by the Constitution’s defenders (it was expressed perhaps most famously in Madison’s Federalist No. 39). Nonetheless, the compromise was neither immediately nor graciously embraced by the other members from the large states, Madison first among them, who considered themselves to be on the losing side of the compromise.  Immediately following the decisive vote on representation, the delegates proceeded to deliberate on the nature and extent of powers that should be given to the new Congress. It became clear that—now that the issue of representation was settled—certain members from both sides of the debate were ready to rethink their original position on the degree of power to be exercised by this novel “partly federal, partly national” government. Many members from the small states were now ready to place more trust (and more powers) in this new government, a government which would protect their interests as states. And some members from the large states now expressed misgivings about giving so much power to a legislature that would still be “partly federal” in its structure—and hence could not be expected to always act for the good of the whole.

Other features in the Constitution reinforced the “partly federal, partly national” character of the Constitution. The powers of the new Congress would be broad, but not indefinite. The first house would be chosen directly by the people; the second house would be chosen by the state legislatures (to keep the senators closely aligned to state interests, as such). The first house would be elected for two years (to keep them responsive to the people’s will); members of the second house would serve for six years and would not be subject to recall (to keep them more independent of the state legislatures than they had been under the Articles). And finally, the salary of all the legislators would be paid out of the national treasury (once again, to secure their independence from state influence). These features recognized the legitimacy to be found in the competing claims of both sides of the question and a growing consensus over the kind of nation they were forming.
