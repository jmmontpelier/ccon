It resolved only “that provision ought to be made for the amendment of the Articles of Union whensoever it shall seem necessary,” and it made only one suggested proviso: “that the assent of the National Legislature ought not to be required thereto.” When the resolution was first debated in the Committee of the Whole, the initial objections were from a surprising direction. “Several members,” according to Madison, believed that it was unnecessary to make any provision for amendments at all. Although the need for an amendment process may seem obvious to us today, not all of the state constitutions had provided explicit protocols for their own amendment, and some delegates evidently believed that the new federal Constitution would not need them either. Madison did not record any reasons given for this position, but he did record the reasons given by those who insisted that an amendment provision be added. \t Elbridge Gerry said that “the novelty and difficulty of the experiment [of writing a new constitution] requires periodical revision.” George Mason was more blunt: “The plan now to be formed will certainly be defective, as the Confederation has been found on trial to be. Amendments, therefore, will be necessary; and it will be better to provide for them in an easy, regular, and constitutional way, than to trust to chance and violence.” The delegates unanimously chose to make some provision “for the amendment of the Articles of Union whensoever it shall seem necessary,” but they postponed any consideration of whether that provision should bypass the Congress.

The Committee’s report proposed that: “On the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the states in the Union, for an amendment of this Constitution, the legislature of the United States shall call a convention for that purpose.” According to this process, the state legislatures would be the originators of all amendments, and a general convention would be the means of ratifying them. Congress would be limited to the pro forma task of calling for a convention, but it would have no role to play either in proposing amendments or deciding whether they should be adopted.  Gouverneur Morris did not care for the way that the Committee’s report relegated Congress to a position of insignificance, and he “suggested, that the legislature  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1177","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1177","title":"should be left at liberty to call a convention whenever they pleased.” He therefore started the idea that Congress should be allowed to have some agency in the amendment process, at least some of the time. For almost two weeks the Convention stuck to their decision that all amendments should be ratified in a national convention and that national conventions should be formed whenever two-thirds of the states asked for one.   But Elbridge Gerry feared that amendments might be passed too easily with the mode that they had adopted, and therefore it would put state prerogatives in jeopardy. “This Constitution, he said, is to be paramount to the state constitutions. It follows, hence, from this article, that two thirds of the states may obtain a convention, a majority of which can bind the Union to innovations that may subvert the state constitutions altogether. He asked whether this was a situation proper to be run into.” Gerry’s motion to reconsider gained overwhelming support, 9-to-2, but everyone seemed to have their own reasons for thinking the mode they had adopted needed to be reconsidered.

He then suggested that it should require three-fourths of the states, and this choice was accepted unanimously. Madison thought they should consider an alternative formulation. He moved that amendments would be proposed by Congress—either when two-thirds of both Houses of Congress initiated the process or when two-thirds of the state legislatures requested Congress to act. Proposed amendments could then be ratified either by three-fourths of the state legislatures or by three-fourths of state ratifying conventions. Finally, Congress could always decide which mode of ratification was to be sought in each case. The delegates adopted Madison’s proposal by a 9-to-1 vote, with New Hampshire divided.  This proposal now involved both the state legislatures and Congress in the process, but it no longer allowed a way to bypass Congress altogether.

Members from the small states had begun to feel uneasy that the equality that they had managed to achieve in the Senate—a concession which they had managed to wrest from the other states after considerable difficulty—might one day be taken from them through the amendment process. They therefore tried various stratagems to bolster the strength of the small states in the amendment process. Ultimately, the delegates agreed to add “a further proviso,—‘that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.’”  \t George Mason, who had always been the chief advocate for the principle that states should be able to bypass Congress in the amendment process, now objected to the way that the original proposal had been transformed. As the provision now stood, whichever mode was chosen for proposing amendments, Congress would be involved either “immediately” or “ultimately.” The states would have no recourse for remedying constitutional ills “if the government should become oppressive, as he verily believed would be the case.” Morris and Gerry therefore suggested that, whenever two-thirds of the states requested amendments, the proposal for the amendments would be generated in a general convention instead of Congress. Madison again objected that this appeal to a general convention was too vague, because no provision was made for how such a convention should be formed or how it would vote.

After all, the delegates were themselves deliberately flouting the amendment process of the Articles of Confederation precisely because that compact had never been ratified in any authoritative way. If the new constitution were ratified properly, then it could not later be evaded or rescinded in the same way that the Convention was now discarding the Articles. After this speech, the motion to ratify by state legislatures lost by 3-to-7, and the original resolution for a popular ratification won by 9-to-1.

As the issue was addressed on August 30 and 31, it became clear that the delegates’ notions on this subject were diverse. Wilson proposed a simple majority of seven, but was willing to go as high as eight; Sherman thought that no less than ten should be required as a substitute for a provision that had previously required unanimity; Randolph suggested nine; and Dickinson urged that they should stick with thirteen (and Sherman switched his preference to unanimity as well). Madison and Gouverneur Morris both proposed a two-pronged qualification for ratification. Morris wanted a lower number if the states were contiguous and a higher number if the ratifying states were non-contiguous. Madison thought that a majority of states would be sufficient only if they also represented a majority of the population, but a higher number of states should be required until they reached a majority of the population. These more elaborate alternatives were never seriously considered. The choice of nine states to ratify was the popular favorite, at 8-to-3.  \t While the delegates were debating the question of the number of states needed to ratify, a few other issues were brought forward. James Wilson thought that all states should be bound by a decision to ratify, even if they were not among those states who voted in its favor: “We must, he said, in this case, go to the original powers of society. The house on fire must be extinguished, without a scrupulous regard to ordinary rights.” No one else supported this autocratic approach, however, and they chose instead to add the words, “between the said states,” to clarify and reinforce their intention that the Constitution would only operate over those states who chose to ratify it.

On August 31, Gouverneur Morris and Charles Pinckney moved to strike out the words requiring the approbation of Congress as a necessary step. The Framers accepted the change, on an 8-to-3 vote, but they did not immediately decide on a formulation to take its place. The question was debated more fully on September 10. Elbridge Gerry wished to reconsider the whole clause, especially because “he objected to proceeding to change the government without the approbation of Congress, as being improper, and giving just umbrage to that body.” Hamilton agreed on the “indecorum” of slighting Congress, and thought the approbation of that body should be a “necessary ingredient in the transaction.” Thomas Fitzsimons of Pennsylvania “remarked, that the ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1204","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1204","title":" words ‘for their approbation’ had been struck out in order to save Congress from the necessity of an act inconsistent with the Articles of Confederation, under which they held their authority.” It now became a question of either risking umbrage by snubbing Congress or placing that body in an awkward position: asking them to explicitly acquiesce to an “unconstitutional” mode of amending the Articles.   Rufus King gave it as his opinion that “it would be more respectful to Congress, to submit the plan generally to them, than in such a form as expressly and necessarily to require their approbation or disapprobation,” and Sherman agreed with King. Wilson’s objections were more practical. He thought it would be “worse than folly” to hang their hopes on the assent of Congress. He complained: “After spending four or five months in the laborious and arduous task of forming a government for our country, we are ourselves throwing insuperable obstacles in the way of its success.” The others seemed to agree, and the ratification provision (which no longer included the clause requiring the approbation of Congress) was again passed, 10-to-1.

This resolution, which was given its final form by the Committee of Style on September 13, describes how the Constitution should be “laid before the United States in Congress assembled.” It then humbly describes the process whereby—in “the opinion of this Convention”—the Constitution should be submitted to the state legislatures and ultimately to ratifying conventions within each state. It concludes with instructions on how the first government was to be assembled in the event of ratification. The Framers’ final word on the ratification process was intended to incorporate the existing organs of government in the United States—the federal and state legislatures—in the formalities of ratification.

Mason declared “that he would sooner chop off his right hand than put it to the Constitution as it now stands.” He hoped that they might yet change some of the most objectionable parts of the plan before they adjourned, but if that was not possible, then he wished instead that the plan of government be submitted to “another General Convention.” Edmund Randolph had been from the first a steadfast advocate for a popular ratification, and he had also thought that is was proper that only nine states were sufficient to ratify. Nonetheless, now that the Constitution contained so many disagreeable features, he was reverting to a version of the position that he had stated to Madison weeks before the Convention had begun its work. He wished “that the state conventions should be at liberty to propose amendments, to be submitted to another General Convention, which may reject or incorporate them, as may be judged proper.” The rest of the delegates resisted this new assault which would (as they saw it) doom their months-long efforts to certain defeat. They were unwilling to risk a nationwide debate over accepting each individual provision independent of the whole.

He thought that the Virginia Plan that he had read to the Convention in its opening days had been a model of republican freedom, but the ensuing debates had deformed its essential features. What choice did the Convention leave him? “Was he to promote the establishment of a plan which he verily believed would end in tyranny?” He accordingly made the formal motion to change the ratifying provision so that the state conventions would have the “power to adopt, reject, or amend; the process to close with another General Convention, with full power to adopt or reject the alterations proposed by the state conventions, and to establish finally the government.” Benjamin Franklin, who was actively promoting harmony and even unanimity in the Convention, seconded Randolph’s motion. Mason then urged his colleagues to allow Randolph’s motion to “lie on the table for a day or two” before deciding on the question.  \t Nothing further was done with this motion at all, and on September 15 Randolph made one final attempt to refer the final ratification process to another general convention after first allowing the states to offer amendments. “Should this proposition be disregarded, it would, he said, be impossible for him to put his name to the instrument. Whether he should oppose it afterwards, he would not then decide; but he would not deprive himself of the freedom to do so in his own state, if that course should be prescribed by his final judgment.” Mason seconded Randolph’s motion and urged its adoption. He insisted: “It was improper to say to the people, take this or nothing.” Mason and Gerry added their names to Randolph’s ultimatum: they could not sign the Constitution unless it held out the promise that final ratification would be by another general convention with the authority to alter the plan according to the wishes of the states.

Charles Pinckney admitted that “these declarations, from members so respectable, at the close of this important scene, give a peculiar solemnity to the present moment.” Nonetheless, what they were asking was too high a price for the privilege of bringing them back into the fold. If they agreed to allow a new Convention to revisit these questions, and only after the people had been drawn into the deliberations, he predicted that: “Nothing but confusion and contrariety will spring from the experiment. The states will never agree in their plans, and the deputies to a second Convention, coming together under the discordant impressions of their constituents, will never agree. Conventions are serious things, and ought not to be repeated.” Madison reported that when the delegates voted on Randolph’s motion to change their mode of ratification, “all the states answered, no. On the question to agree to the Constitution, as amended [by the Convention], all the states, ay.”  \t The Framers thus presented the American people with an ultimatum: they must accept all or nothing. Critics of the Constitution—both in Congress and in the ratifying conventions—blasted this choice. But the Framers knew better than anyone that the proposed Constitution, for all of its flaws, had been the product of numerous interrelated compromises, concessions, and bargains between the different states. Pulling out even one loose thread might end by unravelling the whole. During the ratifying period, many of the Federalists remained convinced that no unity would have been possible if the entire country had been invited to become embroiled in the same controversies that had divided the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787.
