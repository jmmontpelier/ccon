Numerous minor disagreements cropped up, but none of them could compete with the broad consensus to finish the remaining business quickly. The last of the “grand bargains” which had roiled competing factions was the 20-year compromise, which was not fully resolved until August 29. After that, the delegates entered into a phase of relative harmony that lasted until the end of the Convention. Unfortunately, their pervasive harmony and impatience to be done led to a few regrettable decisions. Immediately after the Deep South and the Northeastern States had struck their bargain regarding slave importations and navigation acts, the Deep South demanded further protections for recapturing runaway slaves who fled into neighboring states. In response, the Fugitive Slave Clause was duly passed with unanimous votes, almost no objections, and only minor alterations in the wording. In later years, Northern States would come to rue their delegates’ hasty concurrence with the demands of the Southerners, believing that they should have better represented the interests of free states and the cause of freedom. The phrasing of the Fugitive Slave Clause would prove to be a moral, political, and legal nightmare.   The process of electing the president was also worked out in the last days of the Convention. This question had divided the delegates for months, and proposals similar to the Electoral College had already been defeated decisively earlier in the summer. Yet, in light of the persistent dissatisfaction with the prevailing choice to have the president selected by the legislature, the Committee for Postponed Matters presented the plan for an Electoral College in the Convention’s waning days.  The Framers passed this complex proposal with few changes (although its perceived defects would require amendment by 1804).

The subject did not even emerge until September 12, when George Mason, who was one of the three delegates who refused to sign the Constitution, expressed his wish to add one. Mason tried to reassure his colleagues that, “with the aid of the state declarations, a bill might be prepared in a few hours.” The Framers, however, no doubt rightly suspected that such a complex issue, broached this late in the summer, might keep them locked in debate for many more weeks. The charm of Philadelphia had worn off long ago, and many decided they would rather be home for the autumn. After the briefest of exchanges, the motion lost on a tied vote. This decision to forgo a bill of rights, which was probably made with little forethought, or even much thought at all, was a fateful misstep.  The Federalists would learn during the ratification period that many of their detractors (and even many of their friends) believed a bill of rights was essential to the Constitution.

In the second week of September, the delegates decided that their sundry resolutions needed to be reworked into a more organized and elegant shape by a Committee of Style, and they chose a stellar five-man team for the job: William Samuel Johnson, Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Rufus King, and James Madison. Hamilton had been absent for most of the second half of the Convention, but the rest of the members were all trusty stalwarts. And every member was brilliant in his own way. The Convention was still meeting during the day, so the members of the Committee spent their evenings drafting a final Constitution. They pored over the 23 articles that the Committee of Detail had prepared, combined with the innumerable amendments and committee reports that had been accepted since August 6, and they transformed the jumble of resolutions into a coherent plan of government.

Then followed seven neatly arranged articles. The first three articles described the arrangement and powers of the three branches of government: the Congress, the presidency, and the judiciary. The fourth article described the relations of the states to one another and to the new federal government. The fifth article described how to amend the new Constitution. The sixth article guaranteed the payment of the old debts; asserted the supremacy of the federal government when exercising its legitimate powers; and prescribed oaths or affirmations to support the new Constitution. And the seventh article gave a very terse description of what would constitute ratification of the new Constitution. The Committee was ready to have their draft printed on September 12, after barely more than three days’ labors, so that each member could study its design and wording carefully in the Convention’s final few days. Madison was thoroughly pleased by the Committee’s choice of Morris as their draftsman: “A better choice could not have been made, as the performance of the task proved.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_799","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_799","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_800","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_800","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide74312","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Committee of Style","thumbnail":"dr/Slide74312_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si74346","Text_Caption_1265","Text_Caption_1266"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide74312"}}},{"id":"si74433","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_405","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_405","title":"The Final Days of the Convention ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_271","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_271","title":"Randolph, Mason, and Gerry Refuse to Sign ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1268","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1268","title":"Although the last two weeks had primarily been stamped by haste and harmony, the last stage was still taking too long to suit the impatience of some members. On September 11, William Livingston complained to John Jay that he was losing hope of returning according to his earlier plan  “by reason of there being certain creatures in this world that are more pleased with their own speeches than they can prevail upon anybody else to be.” Livingston might have had the Convention’s three dissenters in mind when he wrote his letter. The day before, all three non-signers of the Constitution—Edmund Randolph, George Mason, and Elbridge Gerry—had voiced their increasing alarm at the shape the document was taking. The advocates of the Constitution may have found it tedious to listen to the repeated objections of the dissenters at this late hour. Mason, however, felt that their concerns were being silenced and ignored, and that this assembly had turned into a cabal in its last days. He later confided to Jefferson ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1269","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1269","title":" that he had been “discouraged” from voicing his personal objections to the Constitution, “by the precipitate, & intemperate, not to say indecent manner in which the Business was conducted, during the last Week of the Convention.” The indecent treatment, he went on to say, was occasioned by the coalition that had been formed between the Deep South and the Northeastern states over the 20-year compromise over the slave trade.   On September 10, Randolph stated the various reasons why he thought the plan “would end in Tyranny.” And on September 15, Gerry named numerous objections “which determined him to withhold his name from the Constitution.”  The details of their respective objections differed from one another, but all three dwelt on the concentration of power, on particular powers they believed would be abused, and on the improper distribution of powers that were being granted to the three branches of the new government.  All three non-signers dangled the promise that they could be brought around, if only the Convention would agree to allow the states to submit amendments, and the final determination could be made by a second general convention. This offer had no chance of success, since the other delegates were convinced that a second general convention—probably made up of delegates who would arrive saddled with stringent and contradictory demands from each state—was a sure recipe for failure.

On September 6, Madison admitted to Jefferson that, in his opinion, “the plan should it be adopted will neither effectually answer its national object nor prevent the local mischiefs which every where excite disgusts against the state governments.” Madison was still deeply concerned by the equal power of the states in the Senate, and even more the lack of a federal veto over state laws. In spite of his pessimism about the plan, however, Madison believed it was of paramount importance that it be adopted: “If the present moment be lost it is hard to say what may be our fate.”  Similarly, Hamilton expressed his own doubts about the Constitution on the last day of the Convention: “No man’s ideas were more remote from the plan than his were known to be.” Nonetheless, he urged ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1272","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1272","title":" every delegate to support the Constitution, because he saw their choices as lying “between anarchy and Convulsion on one side, and the chance of good to be expected from the plan on the other.” Both Madison and Hamilton, swallowing their personal misgivings, would be champions in the fight for ratification.   On September 15, in the turbulent wake of the threatening voices of the Constitution’s detractors, the Convention made its most momentous choice that summer. The day had been an especially long one, stretching into the evening. A plethora of trivial motions had been proposed, most of which were rejected. The three non-signers had made a last-ditch effort to forestall what they considered would be a disaster, but their call for a second general convention was met with a resounding negative. Finally, Madison reported simply: “On the question to agree to the Constitution, as amended. All the States ay.” This vote took place on a Saturday evening, and the text of the Constitution was handed over to Jacob Shallus, the assistant clerk for the Pennsylvania General Assembly, to be engrossed onto vellum parchment (a soft but durable animal hide) before their final meeting on Monday, September 17.

Franklin told his colleagues that he intended to support the Constitution because he believed that a new plan of government was necessary, and he doubted whether any convention could make a better one:  For, when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views. From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does.  He counseled his fellow delegates on the importance of maintaining a unified front in support of the Constitution. “The opinions I have had of its errors,” Franklin said, “I sacrifice to the public good. I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad. Within these walls they were born, and here they shall die.” The success of their endeavors would depend on the opinion of “our real or apparent unanimity.” He concluded his speech with a specific appeal to the Constitution’s detractors: “I cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the Convention, who may still have objections to it, would with me, on this occasion, doubt a little of his own infallibility, and, to make manifest our unanimity, put his name to this instrument.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_807","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_807","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_808","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_808","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1078","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1078","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1324","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1324","title":"Benjamin Franklin, ca. 1767.

Madison made no bones about the reason for the “ambiguous form” in which the delegates were asked to sign their name.

This “Letter of Transmittal” had been composed in the Committee of Style. It was almost certainly written by Gouverneur Morris; it was signed by the Convention’s president, George Washington; and it was addressed to the president of Congress. Writing this letter had been a ticklish business: by recommending the Constitution to Congress, they were addressing the very body they were seeking to displace. The first task in the letter, therefore, was a sort of apology to its recipient. The delegates explained that they were obeying the wishes of all true “friends of our country” when they crafted a general government with greater powers rather than simply proposing specific amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Nonetheless, a government with extensive powers came at a cost; “the impropriety of delegating such extensive trust to one body of men is evident; hence results the necessity of a different organization.” The old Congress—a unicameral legislature with no separation of powers—was simply incompatible with a new and improved, and decidedly more powerful, government.

This Constitution was a product of compromise, and they believed the compromises were “liable to as few exceptions as could reasonably have been expected.” The Framers concluded their message by saying that it was their “most ardent wish” that the new Constitution would “promote the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all and secure her freedom and happiness.” The first salvo in the battle for ratification had begun.

States entertained almost paranoid fears that Congress would use that provision to extinguish free elections altogether.  Similarly, the Constitution had stipulated that direct taxes must be “in Proportion to the Census”—which included the three-fifths provision for slaves—but it had placed no limitations on how high the rate of direct taxes might go, nor on how intrusive the federal government might become when collecting them. Every state that had recommended amendments had requested limitations on Congress’ power of taxation. Many states had argued that, at the very least, Congress should not be empowered to exercise either power—over elections or direct taxation—unless the states had failed to act. Madison responded to these requests for limiting the taxing power by saying that the Constitution’s enemies were trying to “mutilate the system.” Without the taxing power, he thought, “the system cannot answer the purposes for which it was intended.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_832","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_832","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_833","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_833","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_834","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_834","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1073","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1073","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide77017","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"EC - Fear of election regulation, taxation without limit","thumbnail":"dr/Slide77017_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si77317","si77319","Image_1071","Image_1072","Text_Caption_1316","Text_Caption_1317","Image_1073"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide77017"}}},{"id":"si77411","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si77413","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1074","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1074","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1075","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1075","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_421","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_421","title":"The Final Days of the Convention ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_283","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_283","title":"Congress’ Debates Over the Bill of Rights ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1318","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1318","title":"Hamilton Reassures Congress ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_835","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_835","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_836","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_836","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_837","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_837","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1325","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1325","title":"Alexander Hamilton, who probably understood public finance better than anybody, had already tried to soothe these fears during the ratification process.

And Hamilton’s reassurance proved correct. Even without any amendment to that effect, most federal revenue was collected through duties until the 16th Amendment allowed Congress to collect income taxes in 1913. Until that time, direct taxation was only imposed a few times, and only during exigent circumstances. Nor has the congressional power to regulate elections ever been used to abolish free elections.
