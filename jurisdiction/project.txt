The federal judiciary was to consist of inferior courts which would hear cases “in the first instance,” meaning they would have original jurisdiction; they would not be constrained to deciding cases that had been appealed by other (presumably state) courts. The Virginia Plan also proposed establishing “one or more supreme tribunals,” which would “hear and determine [cases], in the dernier resort.” This meant that the Supreme Court(s) would have the last say on any question; there would be no higher tribunal to which its judgments could be appealed.

But this broad jurisdiction would have been commensurate with a national legislature that had similarly amorphous boundaries. The Virginia Plan, after all, would have empowered Congress “to legislate in all cases, to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the exercise of individual legislation.” When deciding how broad the jurisdiction of the federal courts should be, then, the Framers were again revisiting the question of how much power the federal government should exercise vis-à-vis the states. And this question was bound to be controversial.  When the Committee of the Whole considered the Virginia Plan’s judiciary provisions on June 4, no one objected to the initial proposition that federal courts should be established, and the resolution passed unanimously. The Committee altered the wording merely to make clear that there should be only one “supreme tribunal,” but there would be “one or more inferior tribunals.” The next day, however, the question of inferior tribunals became more controversial, as delegates began to wonder whether a swarm of federal courts might intrude on the authority of the existing state courts.

He feared that many cases tried in state courts would result in “improper verdicts,” owing to “the biased directions of a dependent judge, or the local prejudices of an undirected jury.” Additionally, requiring parties to bring their cases to the seat of the federal government (if there were only one Supreme Court) would be too inconvenient for everyone concerned. An effective government with broad legislative powers required a federal judiciary with commensurate jurisdiction to decide those cases arising under federal law. “A government without a proper executive and judiciary,” Madison warned, would be a return to their impotent condition under the Articles of Confederation: “the mere trunk of a body, without arms or legs to act or move.” Wilson agreed, and he added that the federal courts needed more than appellate jurisdiction, since certain questions, such as admiralty cases, did not belong within the jurisdiction of state courts at all.  \t In spite of the protests by those who insisted that a new federal system of inferior courts was absolutely necessary, Rutledge’s motion to strike out the provision that would have established them passed the Committee, 6-to-4, with Massachusetts divided. Wilson and Madison then tried a different tack, based on an idea started by John Dickinson. Instead of a positive declaration in the Constitution that there shall be lower courts, they moved that Congress “be empowered to institute inferior tribunals.” After some brief argument from Pierce Butler, the delegates were convinced: they decided, 8-to-2, to give Congress the power to institute inferior courts as needed.

Although the list is extensive, its effect was to significantly curtail the potential jurisdiction of the federal judiciary from the simpler yet vague formulation that the Convention had devised. No longer could a federal court examine any “questions as may involve the national peace and harmony.” Instead, the list included, in addition to “all cases arising under laws passed by the legislature of the United States,” the cases involving maritime questions, foreigners, ambassadors, and other “public ministers and consuls,” and most controversies arising between states. Also, although the delegates had decided to remove the impeachment power from the courts, the committee’s report stipulated that the Supreme Court would be responsible for the trial of all impeachments. (The trial of impeachments would be changed to the Senate by the Committee on Postponed Matters, which reported on September 4, principally because the Supreme Court might be the body to try the president for a crime after he had been removed from office through the impeachment process.) Finally, the August 6 report made clear that the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction over federal laws would be appellate only, but it empowered Congress to assign original jurisdiction in the inferior courts where necessary.

They decided to fill the courts’ dockets with all controversies in which the United States was a party and all territorial disputes between the states. On August 27, the delegates decided, following the suggestion of William Samuel Johnson of North Carolina, that the power of the federal courts should “extend to equity as well as law.” But Johnson wanted to go still further. The courts’ jurisdiction should include not only “cases arising under” federal laws, but under “this Constitution” as well. After making assurances that this change would still limit the courts to deciding only Constitutional cases “of a judiciary nature,” Johnson’s amendment passed unanimously. On that day and the one following, a few more minor changes were made, with little debate, to the clauses that would become Article III.  \t The final wording of Article III established a system of federal courts with jurisdiction that was expected to be both powerful and constrained. Such a jurisdiction was commensurate with the powerful but constrained Congress that the Framers had simultaneously created. The existing state or local courts would continue to be the venues for trying most of the crimes committed within the United States, as well as most civil cases. The federal courts were primarily reserved for the trials of federal crimes, piracies, and those civil disputes that took place at sea, or when the parties to the dispute included foreigners, the federal government, and two or more states or citizens from different states.

Gerry ominously predicted that “the Judicial [power] will be oppressive.” Mason went into greater detail and more dire predictions: “The Judiciary of the United States is so constructed and extended, as to absorb and destroy the judiciaries of the several States; thereby rendering law as tedious, intricate and expensive, and justice as unattainable, by a great part of the community, as in England, and enabling the rich to oppress and ruin the poor.” During the ratifying debates, some of the Antifederalists, notably Brutus, likewise denounced the oppressions they expected to arise from the new federal judiciary. Some of these objections and accusations continue to the present day. Most of the Framers, however, were satisfied with the breadth of jurisdiction in the system of courts that they had created.

It is no accident that three of the amendments in the Bill of Rights sought to buttress the right to a jury trial (the right of grand juries in the 5th Amendment; the right to an “impartial” jury derived from “the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed” in the 6th Amendment; and jury trials for civil cases in the 7th Amendment). For Americans in the eighteenth century, given their experience in the late colonial period under Britain, having judicial decisions depend upon jurors who were drawn from the citizenry was almost as important as forming a legislature that would be popularly elected.  They would brook no Constitution that seemed to trifle with this keystone of free government.

The Framers were unwilling to descend into particulars about the precise mode in which juries would be assembled or to enumerate all the cases in which they would be required because different states had different requirements regarding juries, making it impossible to find a uniform rule that would satisfy everyone. They hoped instead that the Constitution could safely trust Congress to work out the individual rules and the specific requirements for jury trials. And if the Framers were complacent about juries, it was not because they thought them unimportant; on the contrary, they believed that their importance was so obvious that they did not need prolonged and minute guarantees about them in the Constitution.   However, the accusations of the Antifederalists, and even some friends of the Constitution, convinced the First Congress that greater specificity would have to be added immediately, both in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and within a bill of rights that would be incorporated into the Constitution itself.

The delegates merely added a clause that provided for those circumstances when a federal crime was “not committed within any state, then the trial shall be at such place or places as the legislature may direct.” Thus, without debate or apparent deliberation, the Framers provided for jury trials in federal criminal cases, and they did so in a way that they must have believed would satisfy the most jealous guardian of individual rights.   On September 12, however, Hugh Williamson pointed out “that no provision was yet made for juries in civil cases, and suggested the necessity of it.” By this time, however, less than a week before the end of the Convention, the delegates were reluctant to entertain any new proposals that might slow down their race to the finish line.

Finally, opponents to the Constitution wanted to be assured that indictments would be procured by a grand jury, in order to protect the rights of the accused from an overzealous federal prosecutor. The Federalists were not indifferent to these protections; rather, they had believed that niceties such as these could be sufficiently settled by Congress. The reaction of many opponents to the Constitution convinced the nation otherwise. Consequently, not only did the First Congress address many of these concerns in the Judiciary Act of 1789, but amendments were also added to the Constitution which supplemented the sparse provisions in Article III for jury trials in federal cases.

The final wording of this clause was offered by Oliver Ellsworth, who suggested that Congress have the power: “To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States, and offences against the laws of nations.” That wording was agreed to without dissent.

Wilson again objected to giving the power of definition to Congress: “To pretend to define the law of nations, which depended on the authority of all the civilized nations of the world, would have a look of arrogance that would make us ridiculous.” Morris countered that the law of nations was “too vague” to be a proper rule for the courts (meaning, in essence, that unless the power to define was placed in Congress that the power would rest in the judiciary by default). The Convention narrowly agreed with Morris and decided to strike the word “punish,” lodging the power of definition in Congress by a vote of 6-to-5.

While a British colony American ships were protected by the British Navy, but once the Americans had acquired their independence the British diplomats were swift to inform the Barbary States that American ships were in open season.  Thomas Jefferson, then acting as the U.S. Minister to France, attempted to build  a coalition of weaker naval powers to defeat Algiers, the most powerful of the Barbary States. This action was ultimately unsuccessful, and it was not until the ratification of the Constitution that the U.S. Government had the power to levy taxes and maintain armed forces that had been absent under the Articles of Confederation.   An earlier joint action by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps had secured American interests in the area by 1805, but in 1812, Algiers declared war on the United States. Timed to coincide with the opening of the War of 1812, the U.S. could not address the Barbary Pirates until after the Treaty of Ghent. James Madison requested for Congress to authorize a force to Algiers—an entire squadron led by Commodore Stephen Decatur. Decatur defeated the Algerians in 1815 and was able to force them to treaty, and with them the less powerful states of Tunis and Tripoli. American shipping rights were secured, though Congress would not ratify the treaty until 1822.  To this day, the U.S. Marine Corps maintains a special connection with James Madison: each year they lay the wreath on James Madison’s grave at Montpelier.
