As a precocious student at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton), he encountered Scottish Enlightenment principles under the tutelage of John Witherspoon. But his bookish habits did not end when his formal education did. In 1773, the year after he graduated and when he was still a young man of 22, he wrote to his former classmate, William Bradford: “The principles and Modes of Government are too important to be disregarded by an Inquisitive mind and I think are well worthy [of] a critical examination by all students that have health and Leisure.” To that end, he asked Bradford to send him information about the origin and fundamental principles of Pennsylvania’s constitution, especially as regards religious freedom.   James Madison first learned about the deficiencies of confederal arrangements from firsthand experience. He had been a member of the Confederation Congress from 1780 to 1783 and again from 1787 to 1788. There, he found that congressional acts were continually stymied by insufficient powers and uncooperative states. In the interim, he served in Virginia’s General Assembly from 1784 to 1787, where he became frustrated by the inadequacies of the Confederation from the perspective of a state legislator, including Congress’ inability to prevent the states from abusing individual rights. At the same time that he was acquiring his practical knowledge of politics within the two legislatures, he began supplementing this knowledge with a rigorous study of the best historical and theoretical books he could get his hands on.

He was spending the winter of 1784 at Montpelier, his home in the Piedmont region of Virginia, embarking on a course of study that he had outlined for himself. He complained to a friend about the various interruptions and the limited resources in his library that were slowing his progress through his books.   In March 1784, Madison wrote an important letter to Thomas Jefferson in Paris, commissioning his good friend to purchase numerous books for him. He gave Jefferson carte blanche in selecting the books that he thought worthy of adding to his library, remarking: “you know tolerably well the objects of my curiosity.” Nonetheless, he laid special emphasis on purchasing books that would shed light on “the several confederacies which have existed.. . . The operations  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_939","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_939","title":"of our own [Confederacy] must render all such lights of consequence.” Book orders took much longer to fill two centuries before Amazon came on the scene, and Jefferson was still in the process of purchasing books for Madison eight months later, when he hinted that his commission would be made easier if Madison could send him a catalogue of the books that he wanted. Madison reiterated that he trusted Jefferson’s judgment in the regard; besides, if he attempted to enumerate such a catalogue, he was certain to find that his wish-list exceeded both his resources and Jefferson’s patience.   Finally, in January of 1786—nearly two years after Madison’s book order was initially placed—two trunks of books  arrived for him in Richmond. He immediately had them conveyed to his home at Montpelier. Once he had finally unpacked and examined his precious “literary cargo” in March, he repeatedly and enthusiastically assured Jefferson how well pleased he was by the choices: “The collection is perfectly to my mind.” Armed with this collection, he was ready to embark on one of the most important research projects ever carried out in this country.

He relied heavily on many recently published French collections—including Felice’s 13-volume Code de l’humanité and the first several volumes of the Encyclopédie méthodique—but he also drew on ancient historians, such as Plutarch and Polybius, and modern political theorists, such as Montesquieu.  \t His researches culminated in a methodical outline of the structures and organization of three ancient confederacies (the Amphictyonic, Achaean, and Lycian) and three modern ones (the Germanic, Swiss, and Belgic or Holland). For each confederacy, he included a description of their structure and governance, paying particular attention to the organization of their federal authority and listing their “vices”—those features that made them cumbersome, unworkable, or even fatal. All of these examples seemed to confirm what he had long been suspecting: the weak bonds of union in these confederacies engendered dissension among the parts, weakness against their foes, and an instability that often doomed their survival. In order for a confederacy to be built to last, there must be more authoritative power at the center.

The stated mission of that meeting was limited to commercial reform, and the underrepresented assembly hadn’t even been able to address that topic before adjourning. But in just a year’s time—much sooner than he had any reason to hope for when he embarked on the project—Madison would be drawing upon these notes in his formulation of a new plan of government and in his defense of that plan.  \t During the debates at the Constitutional Convention, Madison frequently referred to lessons drawn from history, and many of these lessons were first noted in the observations that he had recorded in his notes. When Oliver Ellsworth claimed that all previous confederated states had retained their equality within the confederation, Madison quickly “reminded Mr. Ellsworth of the Lycian confederacy, in which the component members had votes proportioned to their importance.” He went on to say that, even if the facts were otherwise, these ancient examples formed no fit model to emulate, since they had all been failures in their own ways. Madison used his notes even more extensively during the ratification debates, both in his published essays and within Virginia’s Ratifying Convention. In Federalist Nos. 18 through 20, he copied passages from the notes almost verbatim. These notes helped cement Madison’s reputation for being the best prepared delegate at the Constitutional Convention.

The title of his newest project was “Vices of the Political System of the United States.” The document is a more polished and focused piece of writing than the fragmentary “Notes” he had compiled of other confederacies. In it, he enumerated the defects experienced under the Articles of Confederation (the failure of the states to comply with requisitions, encroachments by the states on the federal authority, abuses of one state by another, etc.), and next to each heading, Madison supplied examples from recent history and dire warnings of the evils that would inevitably proceed from that vice.

But the United States would be dangerously naïve to expect such forbearance to last, and as long as the Articles remained unchanged, violations such as these could be expected to continue.   Madison elaborated on each of the Confederation’s vices: its insufficient powers, its inability to execute the powers it did possess, and the states’ trespasses upon the federal authority as well as the rights of other states. Each of these “vices” had a remedy, most of which amounted to giving more authority to the central government at the expense of the states. For instance, one of the defects of the existing Articles was that it had been ratified by the state legislatures. Therefore, any time a state legislature violated the terms of the Articles, it was unclear which act of the legislature should take precedence—its prior agreement to abide by the Articles or its subsequent violation of them. The solution, then, was for a new compact to be formed and ratified by the people of each state, which would clarify that the federal compact took precedence over ordinary state laws.

Their deficiencies were not merely a matter of the balance of powers between the state and federal governments being out of kilter; rather, lacking a firm hand at the tiller, the entire experiment in republican government was breaking down within the states—the very bodies that were supposed to exemplify the republican form of government.

Of all the vices that Madison found blameworthy in the state laws, none received more condemnation than their injustice. Republican governments had to pass only two tests to prove their legitimacy. First, the source of all political power to be derived from the people; second, governments must be instituted for the protection of the people’s rights. The brutal truth, Madison was coming to realize, was that governments that could pass the first test with flying colors usually failed the second test. Religious majorities threatened the rights of religious minorities, and property rights were threatened by the clamorous demands of the debtor class. When the majority of people acted tyrannically so consistently, it called into question the political wisdom of deriving all power from the people. Madison warned that the injustice of state laws “brings more into question the fundamental principle of republican Government, that the majority who rule in such Governments, are the safest Guardians both of public Good and of private rights.” The very future of popular forms of government therefore depended on finding some remedy for the scourge of unjust state laws.

The true source of the evils they were experiencing, he thought, was not the structure of government; in truth, political arrangements could only exacerbate or ameliorate the real problem. The true source of their ills could be found in the nature of man. People favor their own interests above the common good; therefore, whichever group holds the reigns of political power can be expected to use it for their own benefit to the detriment of others. This outcome would always be the case unless some measures were taken to prevent it. And the measures that had already been tried in the state governments—bills of rights or separation of powers—had so far proved too ineffectual to counter the magnitude of the problem.

Most people at this time believed that republics needed to be small, in order to render the citizenry loyal toward their compatriots. Madison argued instead that republics needed to be much larger, in order to keep self-interested motives from infecting a majority of the citizenry. In larger republics, “the society becomes broken into a greater variety of interests, of pursuits, of passions, which check each other.” Madison made clear that the people in a large republic were no less prone to following selfish interests than they were in a small republic; nevertheless, “a common interest or passion is less apt to be felt and the requisite combinations less easy to be formed by a great than by a small number.” When a majority interest did form on a particular issue, the members of that group were likely to differ on other issues, preventing formation of an oppressive faction. Hence, the structure of government, and especially its extended size, could mitigate the lethal effects of faction.    Madison’s diagnosis of the Confederacy’s infirmities was no less radical than the remedy he proposed for it. Many others at this time were hoping that the forthcoming Convention would solve their international embarrassments and interstate dissensions. And Madison shared these hopes. But he was also trying to solve local problems with continental reform, and he may have been the only delegate to arrive in Philadelphia with that object. But if the Convention’s proposed government had any chance of success, it would have to provide solutions to the whole array of problems. If each of the “Vices of the Political System of the United States” that Madison named implied a corresponding virtue, his next project was to turn those implied virtues into a plan.

As he explained to a couple of his fellow delegates from Virginia, other states would expect “some leading propositions at least” from the Virginians. Not only was Virginia the most populous state, but it had led the charge in making the Convention a reality, and the other states would look to Virginia to take the lead once the Convention started. Acting upon that expectation, Madison said he had been “led to revolve the subject which is to undergo the discussion of the Convention, and formed in my mind some outlines of a new system.” Writing from New York, he shared these outlines with George Washington and Edmund Randolph, and he urged them to be “on the ground in due time” before the Convention in Philadelphia. He was hoping the Virginians could meet before the Convention opened, so that they could harmonize their opinions and present a unified front when they introduced their “leading propositions” to replace the Articles. Madison himself arrived nearly two weeks before the Convention was scheduled to open; he was on the scene earlier than any other delegate except the ones who lived in Philadelphia.  The outlines of the plan that Madison shared with his Virginian colleagues was a radical departure from both the letter and the “spirit” of the Articles of Confederation. Edmund Randolph, Virginia’s governor, had already confided to Madison some more timid and tepid changes he had in mind, that would be grafted on to the existing Articles. Madison, however, had a complete overhaul in mind: “In truth my ideas of a reform strike so deeply at the old Confederation, and lead to such a systematic change, that they scarcely admit of the expedient [of piecemeal ratification].” Madison’s views, as he revealed to both Randolph and Washington, were that the state sovereignty currently existing under the Articles would need to be seriously curtailed.

Also, Congress should have two houses—a bicameral legislature just as most of the modern sages of government had endorsed—and each house should reflect the relative population or wealth of each state. Finally, Madison proposed giving to the national government the power to veto state laws “in all cases whatsoever.” This power Madison “conceive[d] to be essential and the least possible abridgement of the State Sovereignties.”  \t When the Virginia delegates finally met in Philadelphia before the Convention, they collaborated in putting the finishing touches on Madison’s proposed framework of government. But the “Virginia Plan” (as it came to be known) was unmistakably his brainchild. Nevertheless, the other delegates must have convinced Madison to tone down the wording of his most provocative proposal. Rather than giving the federal government the power to strike down state laws “in all cases whatsoever,” they changed the proposal to read: “to negative all laws passed by the several States, contravening in the opinion of the National Legislature the articles of Union.” This was a more limited power, but still a radical departure from the Articles of Confederation.

But Jefferson, who was in France at the time, later fulminated that that the secrecy had been an abominable precedent. The delegates took this rule very seriously—they know it was crucial to their own success. A few false reports circulated in the press and there were a few inconsequential leaks, but by and large the American people remained in the dark about the content of the Convention’s deliberations. Late in his life, Madison confessed his belief that the Convention would never have been able to adopt the Constitution if the debates had been public. All men want to be able to save face if they have to give up a point, and political men especially. Each of these three unique measures was designed to allow the participants the freedom to think creatively, to speak openly, and to change their minds about certain provisions without public scrutiny. They could do all this without the risk of hasty criticisms for the positions they adopted . . . or the positions they abandoned.

One, ‘old Sawney’ (the very picture of Time with his scythe) waited upon his mistress at 90—to be sure he used to go to sleep in handing a glass of water, almost his only duty.  He had his house and ground, where he raised his favorite vegetables, cabbages and sweet potatoes, as well as chickens and eggs, to be sold to ‘Miss Dolley’ as Mrs. Madison was called by the old lady’s servants...

It was marked by revolutionary advances in science, philosophy, society, and politics. The Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality were founded upon principles of human reason that greatly influenced the Revolution and the political thinking that went in to the Constitution, and several revolutions in Europe, notably the French Revolution.  It is difficult to characterize the philosophy of the Enlightenment in any one particular way, given the wide diversity of Enlightenment thought. The French “philosophes”, (Voltaire, Diderot, D’Alembert, Montesquieu) commented on the aristocratic sociopolitical order of France, in addition to the very significant Scottish Enlightenment (the key figures of which were David Hume and Adam Smith). English thinkers John Locke and Thomas Hobbes were influential in developing ideas of social contract and popular sovereignty.  The scientific and intellectual advancements of the Enlightenment influenced the political institutions, the scientific progress, and the social thinking in Europe and the rest of the Western world for decades, even centuries, after its conclusion.
