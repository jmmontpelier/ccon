Some of the participants no doubt expected or even desired extreme measures, but others at that meeting must have been stunned by the extremity of the changes proposed. Most striking, for some of them, must have been the shift from a federal to a national form of government. The old Articles, after all, had explicitly been a “Confederation” and a “firm league of friendship.” Not once had the Articles referred to the United States as a “nation.” Instead, it had stated unequivocally that “Each state retains its sovereignty.” The Articles of Confederation had been more like a treaty between sovereign nations than a constitution forming a single government. By contrast, the Virginia Plan repeatedly referred to the “national” legislature and the “national” executive that the new system of government would create. And although it never explicitly stated where the supreme or sovereign power resided, one feature in that plan seemed to leave no room for doubt. The sixth resolution granted to the “national” legislature the power “to negative all laws passed by the several States, contravening in the opinion of the National Legislature the articles of Union.” In other words, the national legislature would have the power to veto laws passed by the state legislatures. There could be no mistaking who was the boss in this new system.

By contrast, in the Virginia Plan that he offered to his colleagues, the word national was used 19 times, and the word federal was not used even once.

Elbridge Gerry from Massachusetts expressed the same concern. Other delegates defended the proposal to adopt a more national form of government, at the same time explaining what they meant by the word. Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania repeated what was then a political axiom: “in all communities there must be one supreme power, and one only.” By inference, a federal government was one in which supreme power, or sovereignty, rested in the individual states, and a national government was one in which sovereignty rested in the central government. He preferred the national model. The impossibility of dividing sovereignty was something that was generally accepted at this time.

The new constitution, the national one, would have to empower the central government to “operate on individuals, and would punish those only whose guilt required it.” Mason’s distinction was another point of contention that would persist between those advocating for a more federal form of government and those who wanted a strong national one. But on this day, the nationalists were victorious. When they voted on the question of establishing a national government that would have a supreme legislative, executive, and judiciary, the proposition was passed overwhelmingly.

The happiness of this country, in his opinion, required considerable powers to be left in the hands of the states.” On June 9, James Paterson of New Jersey (who was among those who remained very protective of states’ rights, especially the prerogatives of the small states) once again accused the Convention of exceeding its authority. Congress and the states had authorized “the amendment of the Confederacy,” not its total abolition. He was sure that “the idea of a national government, as contradistinguished from a federal one, never entered into the mind of any of them.” He warned the rest of the delegates that if they pursued the course outlined in the Virginia Plan, he “would not only oppose the plan here but on his return home do every thing in his power to defeat it there.” Yet in spite of these recurring protestations, the arguments and the votes during these first three weeks of the Convention generally seemed to favor the more “nationalist” point of view.

Over the course of the next few days, the two plans were compared and discussed. John Lansing pointed out what he saw as the principal difference: the New Jersey Plan “sustains the sovereignty of the respective states, that of Mr. Randolph destroys it.” Paterson agreed, and emphasized that, since each of the 13 states met as equal sovereigns, it was on that basis that they had to confederate. Edmund Randolph agreed with them about where the crux of the issue lay—“the true question is, whether we shall adhere to the federal plan, or introduce the national plan”—but he differed with them regarding the best answer that could be given to that question. Only a national government would meet their needs. In addition, a merely federal arrangement, like that of Mr. Paterson’s, would require the central government to resort to military coercion every time a state failed to meet its obligation. That would be impracticable and cruel. They needed a government that could extend “a national legislation over individuals,” not just states.

Many people praised his speech, but few at the Convention were willing to go to the extreme lengths which he called for. On the other hand, the majority at the Convention were also opposed to the halfway measures proposed by the New Jersey Plan. On June 19, Madison launched into a lengthy criticism of the inadequacies of the New Jersey Plan. When he had finished, the Convention voted to reject that plan—7 to 3, with one state divided—and to continue their consideration of the Virginia Plan.

Their brief rebellion had shifted the ground of the debates and slowed the momentum of their opponents. Compromise positions were urged with more earnestness. William Samuel Johnson from Connecticut said that he understood that the proponents of the Virginia Plan wished to shift “general sovereignty and jurisdiction” to the new national government, but could they show their adversaries how the states “should retain some portion of sovereignty at least”? Was sovereignty something that could be practically divided between two levels of government? But the debates at the Convention were not only about the terminology of “national,” “federal,” “sovereign,” or “supreme.” Instead, the Framers wove these clashing principles into the concrete provisions of the Constitution. Some (not all) of the delegates from small states sought to restrain national powers only so long as their equal representation in Congress was in doubt.  They were willing to grant greater powers to the central government once they had achieved equality in the Senate.  And some (not all) of the delegates from the large states wanted to concentrate power in the central government only so long as they were assured of a proportional representation in both houses of the legislature.  They began to reign in their ambitions once they had lost the fight in the Senate.  Both political interests and political principles were in play in this debate.

By the end of the Convention, the participants had come to recognize that the government they were constructing was indeed “partly federal and partly national” (just as Madison would later argue in Federalist No. 39). They would devise a system which would, for the first time, attempt to divide sovereignty between the state and the national governments.

When Melancton Smith tried to appeal to that axiom in his arguments against the Constitution, Hamilton responded: “This is curious sophistry. That two supreme powers cannot act together, is false.” Such a mixture only causes problems when the two sovereigns are aimed at each other or at the same object. In the government established by the Constitution, however: “The laws of the United States are supreme, as to all their proper, constitutional objects: the laws of the states are supreme in the same way.” Madison made essentially that same argument in Federalist No. 39. The jurisdiction of the federal government (and hence its supremacy) “extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.” And even before the ratification debates began, George Washington was the first to break the news in the Letter of Transmittal that the Convention sent to Congress along with the new Constitution. It was impossible, he said, “to secure [to each state] all rights of independent sovereignty,” but the states would only have to give up as much sovereignty as was necessary to preserve the rest.

He boasted that the Constitution was totally unique, and “no other Government can furnish a key to its true character. Other Governments present an individual and indivisible sovereignty. The Constitution of the United States divides the sovereignty.” Naysayers had denied that such a system was possible, but the Constitution was designed to prove them wrong: “If sovereignty cannot be thus divided, the political system of the United States is a chimera, mocking the vain pretensions of human wisdom. If it can be so divided, the system ought to have a fair opportunity of fulfilling the wishes and expectations which cling to the experiment.”  Nearly fifty years later, even outside observers like Alexis de Tocqueville agreed with Madison’s assessment. The United States had created something that was so novel that language itself had not yet caught up with the idea. The term “federal” was not adequate to accurately describe this curious arrangement of dividing supremacy between the national and state authorities. He suggested that the United States Constitution had created a new form of “incomplete national government.” His terminology never caught on. Instead, the word “federal” changed its meaning to adapt to the new reality, and people today associate the word with the kind of arrangement embodied in the United States Constitution. But in order to understand the term in all its complexity, the student of American government must move beyond the abstract terms and examine the practical solutions adopted in some key constitutional provisions.
