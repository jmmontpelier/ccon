An independent executive was one who could act with decision and force; he could stand up to the legislature when needed; he could successfully resist any encroachments on executive prerogatives; and he could protect the nation from enemies both at home and abroad. If the Framers had wanted to make the executive office completely independent, they could have vested that power in a single person who held his office for a very long term and was ineligible for a second term (or, if he was reeligible, then the body which elected him must somehow be incapable of being influenced by the incumbent). An independent executive would also be provided with a guaranteed salary that could neither be raised nor diminished during his tenure (to prevent the possibility he could be influenced by either bribery or threats to cut off his means of support). And finally, a thoroughly independent executive could never be punished or removed from office (just as the king’s person had been legally untouchable in Great Britain, and any executive misdeeds were blamed on his ministers).

He could rule in an incompetent or tyrannical manner with impunity, and there would be no remedy for misconduct or maladministration. And the only way to be entirely safe from that peril seemed to be by making the executive branch completely dependent. A dependent executive is one who served for short terms and with no term limits. And the body which was charged with holding him accountable (presumably the legislature) would be empowered to select him, remove him whenever they were dissatisfied, and determine his pay. This wholly dependent executive would have been very safe—if abuses arose in the government, they could never emanate from this office—but this pliable, submissive executive would also never be effective at his job. The Framers were therefore trying to chart a course that would be a middle ground between these two extremes. They acted like a responsible homeowner, who wants a guard dog that has enough freedom and ferocity to chase off intruders but not so much that it might terrorize the neighborhood. In a similar fashion, the Framers were considering very carefully how long the president’s leash should be.

He was “almost unwilling” to admit which method he preferred for appointing the executive, “being apprehensive that it might appear chimerical” to the others. To own the truth, “in theory, he was for an election by the people.” Not only would a popular election produce the best choice, but it would render each branch of the government “as independent as possible of each other.” It would also make the president independent of the state legislatures.  \t Wilson had also favored a short term and reeligibility, but only so long as he wasn’t dependent on the legislature for his reappointment. Wilson’s idea of a popular election was not dismissed out of hand. Mason declared that he “favors the idea, but thinks it impracticable.” He urged Wilson to formulate a workable plan from that idea. Accordingly, the next day Wilson proposed a system that looked very much like what would eventually become the Electoral College. The states would be divided into a certain number of districts, and qualified voters within each district would vote for electors who would, in turn, vote for the chief executive. Wilson’s idea met with a cold reception, but no weighty objections were offered that day. Gerry “liked the principle of Mr. Wilson’s motion,” but he worried that it might alarm the partisans of state authority if the state governments were excluded entirely from the election process. Williamson thought the system offered too little advantage and too much “trouble and expense.” When the question came up for a vote, it lost 8-to-2. The Committee of the Whole then decided to have the national legislature choose the executive (having already decided that he would serve the longer, seven-year term), by the same vote of 8-to-2 (Pennsylvania and Maryland being the only states to object).

Only five days later, Gerry gave notice that he wished to reconsider the mode of appointment in favor of an election by the state executives. It would be the first of many reconsiderations and many different proposed modes of election, most of which would take place in the second half of the summer. But for all the variety in their proposals, the arguments were always similar: the different modes of election would either make the executive too independent, too dependent, dependent on a source that was too easily corrupted, or simply impractical. Hamilton interpreted their perplexity on this subject as a tacit agreement “that no good [executive] could be established on republican principles.” It was high time, he thought, to turn their sights to “the English model.” Only something like a king could really be said to be “above the danger” of corruption from foreign influences “and at the same time was both sufficiently independent and sufficiently controlled, to answer the purpose of the institution at home.” Consequently, he suggested that the method for choosing the executive was less important than the term, and they should choose an executive who would serve for life.

On July 17, James McClurg of Virginia proposed that the executive serve “during good behavior.” If the executive were appointed by the legislature and were eligible for another term, “he was put into a situation that would keep him dependent forever on the legislature; and he conceived the independence of the executive to be equally essential with that of the judiciary department.” Morris seconded the motion and agreed with Hamilton’s position: “He was indifferent how the executive should be chosen, provided he held his place by this tenure.” When the proposal came up for a vote, four states voted in its favor.

Many of those who voted for this term were merely trying to alarm the Convention into reconsidering their current posture, which would have made the executive too dependent on the legislature.  And the Convention did reconsider their original position. Just two days later Wilson observed triumphantly that it seemed now “to be the unanimous sense that the executive should not be appointed by the legislature, unless he be rendered ineligible a second time.” This observation gave Wilson great satisfaction, because he hoped it would reconcile the others to his favorite mode of election: either “mediately or immediately, by the people.” Gouverneur Morris, who often sought to protect the property rights of the wealthy and to make the government as high-toned as possible, “considered an election by the people as the best, by the legislature as the worst, mode.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_780","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_780","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_781","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_781","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide73021","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Hamilton's Strong, Independent Executive","thumbnail":"dr/Slide73021_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si73055","Text_Caption_1245","Text_Caption_1246"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide73021"}}},{"id":"si73142","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si73144","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_396","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_396","title":"Selecting the President ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_262","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_262","title":"Arguments Against Popular Election ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1248","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1248","title":"Charles Pinckney, who often celebrated American equality in his speeches (while frequently voting like an aristocrat), thought “an election by the people [was] liable to the most obvious and striking objections.” He believed that the choice would never really be derived from the people themselves, because they would always “be led by a few active and designing men.” Members from the small states were simply worried that popular elections would mean that their states would have too little influence, because population differences and simple arithmetic would always favor the large states. \t Madison named another difficulty with popular elections: “The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election, on the score of the negroes.” If the Constitution prescribed a popular election for the executive, then the Northern States would have far more influence in the choice than the Southern States, relative to their respective populations. Part of this influence would come from the higher property qualifications that tended to minimize suffrage rights in the South, but the prevalence of slavery would put the Southern States at an even greater disadvantage compared to the votes cast in the North. For that reason, Madison preferred the choice of electors, which would allow them to gloss over that difficulty.

The delegates repeatedly grumbled about giving that power to Congress; they enumerated manifold problems with the mode; and they suggested every possible alternative. But whenever the question came up for a vote, the delegates almost always settled on that choice, sometimes overwhelmingly. Each time they did, however, they had to reconsider the questions of term length and term limits.

Yet the Convention chose neither of these options, and the first comprehensive report of the Convention, delivered on August 6, had the president elected by Congress for seven years and ineligible for a second term. However, when the Convention began debating this specific proposal, an entirely new controversy arose: how exactly should Congress vote for the president? Would a presidential candidate need to receive a majority in both houses of Congress (which would give to each house a veto power over the choice of the other), or should the two houses combine when they cast a ballot for president? The large states were fiercely opposed to giving the small states the power to block the choice of the majority of representatives. Others were afraid of the tumults that would arise if the two houses were simply unable to agree on a single candidate.

The idea of electors was increasingly winning a cadre of supporters, at least in the abstract, but few specific proposals seemed to catch fire. Nonetheless, minor adjustments were continually being suggested as delegates tinkered with the idea, and these adjustments would ultimately make the option more palatable. On July 20, Hugh Williamson suggested that electors should be distributed among the states in the same proportion as their Representatives. This rule would apply the three-fifths ratio to presidential elections, something that would benefit Southern States more than a direct election. A few days later, during a discussion of popular elections, Williamson made a suggestion that would appeal to the smaller states: each voter should vote for more than one candidate for president. This unique approach would make it more likely that one candidate, at least, would not be from the voter’s own state (which would increase the likelihood that a candidate from a small state might be elected president). Morris modified the suggestion to make it a requirement that one of the choices not be from the voter’s home state. Although these suggestions were not adopted at the time they were made, they continued to percolate in the minds of the delegates as they sifted through their options.

For the small states, adding two electors (the number of each state’s Senators) to the total for each state’s electoral votes would give them more influence in the choice; and requiring that one vote be cast for a candidate outside of the elector’s home state made it more likely that someone from a small state might win. For those who were protective of states’ rights, the proposal allowed state legislatures to choose how the president’s electors would be chosen (in the first presidential elections, some electors were popularly elected, others were elected by state legislatures). For that small but stalwart minority of who wanted an election directly by the people, this solution offered at least an intermediate choice by the people. For those who were opposed to the president’s ineligibility, this plan could make him safely eligible for additional terms. And the Committee’s plan even created the office of vice president, specially designed to succeed the president.

The electors would make their selection simultaneously throughout the country and far from the center of government, and then they would dissolve once again into the general citizenry. Consequently, there was never any opportunity for the electors either to influence or to be influenced by the prospective presidential candidates, and “the great evil of cabal was avoided. It would be impossible, also, to corrupt them.” \t Once the delegates recovered from their surprise at being confronted with a new proposal on a subject that they thought had been settled, the drafters of this plan were rewarded with some very tepid praise for their initiative. Mason admitted that the group had “removed some capital objections.” Pierce Butler thought that their complicated scheme was “not free from objections,” but it was better than an election by Congress. And in a masterpiece of guarded encomium, Abraham Baldwin declared that he “thought the plan not so objectionable, when well considered, as at first view.” One by one, the Framers seemed to warm to the plan the more they considered it.

Many in the Convention had believed that no one should be elected president unless they could win a clear majority of votes, yet they feared that it would frequently occur that no clear winner would emerge when there was a crowded field of candidates. The committee had decided that in those instances, the Senate should make the final choice from the five candidates that received the most votes. Many delegates preferred the popular branch of the legislature for this choice, and many more were becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the cozy relationship that had already been established between the president and the Senate when they jointly exercised the powers of making appointments and treaties. The relationship was looking to some uncomfortably like what they would expect between a king and a body of nobles; the last thing that they wanted now was for the Senate to become a body of kingmakers. Yet the small states favored the Senate for one simple reason: it gave them an equal vote with the rest of the states. In the end, it was decided to throw the ultimate determination into the hands of the House, but to give each state only one vote for the choice of president.

Since the mode of electing by an Electoral College allowed the president to be reeligible for multiple terms, they shortened the term he was to serve, from seven to four years (which was still a lengthy term compared to state executives at the time). And since this mode of election also assured the president’s independence from the legislature, the Framers were more comfortable with the prospect of placing the power of impeachment in the hands of Congress (so long as there was a high hurdle of two-thirds before conviction). These various and interrelated provisions for election, term lengths, reeligibility, and impeachment gave the president sufficient independence, they thought, for him to perform his functions effectively, and he was freed from an undue submission to Congress. But the Framers also believed there were sufficient controls built into the system. This powerful official would be held accountable for mismanagement or misdeeds: there would be a “performance review” every four years and, when circumstances warranted it, he could even be “fired” through extraordinary Congressional action. But they designed the presidency so that most abuses would be prevented rather than punished: through the president’s hope for reelection and his fear of reprisals. In sum, they believed that they had made the president’s leash just long enough. And these arrangements for gaining and maintaining his office, combined with the president’s considerable yet constrained powers, created an executive unlike any other that had existed before.
