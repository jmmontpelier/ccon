Madison (1803), the Supreme Court held that part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 violated the United States Constitution. That ruling was an important step in establishing what today is known as “judicial review,” or the power of federal courts to invalidate those acts of the legislative and executive branches of the state and federal governments that are deemed incompatible with the “higher law” of the Constitution. The formidable power of judicial review is nowhere expressly granted in the Constitution, so it is worth asking: When the Constitution was being drafted, did the Framers intend that federal judges would exercise such a power?   \t At no time during the Convention did the Framers ever formally decide whether federal courts should exercise the power of judicial review, but they did address the question indirectly when they debated two other topics. In both situations, the discussions involved constitutional provisions that were proposed but were not incorporated into the Constitution. In both situations, one of the reasons given for rejecting the proposed power was that the courts would be able to perform the same function, with fewer objections, through its power of judicial review. In other words, although the Framers never formally adopted judicial review when they were formulating Article III of the Constitution, when they were addressing proposed additions to other parts of the Constitution, they presumed that the courts would have the power to strike down unconstitutional laws.

Recall that Madison and others had wanted Congress to have the power to veto state legislation. A few of the delegates argued that such a power was unnecessary, because the courts would refuse to give force to any state legislation that contradicted national laws, since federal laws would have superior force. This principle was both broadened and stated more explicitly in the Constitution’s “supremacy clause,” which established that the Constitution and all laws pursuant to the Constitution “shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” Discussion of what became the Supremacy Clause related to the power of the courts to invalidate only state laws, and the clause explicitly binds only state courts to fulfill this function. But the debates over the rejected federal veto and the adopted supremacy clause clearly demonstrate that the Framers expected that the power would not be limited to state courts. Federal courts were also expected to strike down state legislation when it ran afoul of legitimate federal authority, whether those state laws violated treaties, the Constitution, or federal laws made pursuant to the Constitution.

This council would have been formed from “a convenient number of the National Judiciary” and the president; together they would have shared a veto power over proposed legislation from Congress.   Incorporating this kind of council into a constitution, Madison thought, would not only enable the executive and judiciary to protect themselves from encroachments by the legislature, but it would assist the legislature itself to craft laws that were more consistent with the public good. Consequently, when Madison was drafting his own plan of government to submit to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he included a resolution “that the Executive and a Convenient number of the National Judiciary, ought to compose a Council of revision with authority to examine every act of the National Legislature before it shall operate,” and any bills vetoed by this council would have to be repassed by an unspecified proportion in Congress before they could become law.

Elbridge Gerry immediately attacked the proposal with the two objections that would repeatedly doom this measure each time it was resubmitted (and the proposal was resurrected on numerous occasions throughout the summer). First, Gerry did not think that the judiciary should have anything to do with the veto power, “as they will have a sufficient check against encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws, which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality. In some states the judges had actually set aside laws, as being against the constitution. This was done, too, with general approbation.” Gerry was saying that state courts had already adopted the practice that we recognize as judicial review: striking down laws that were contrary to their own state’s constitution. He expected that the federal judiciary would have the same power; therefore, they did not need the additional power of blocking laws before they were passed.  \t Gerry had another reason for objecting to a Council of Revision: judges were unqualified to judge the merits of laws before they were passed. He argued: “It was quite foreign from the nature of their office to make them judges of the policy of public measures.” Judges were supposed to be experts in the law; politicians were supposed to be masters of public policy. Since the expertise required for each was different, the authority to perform these functions should be placed in different hands.

Once the Committee of the Whole rejected the proposal for an absolute veto, they returned to the subject of the Council of Revision. They chose (by a vote of 8-to-2) to grant the veto power to the executive alone, excluding the judiciary from this function, and they decided that a two-thirds vote in each branch of the legislature would be necessary to pass a vetoed bill into law. Wilson and Madison were both so attached to the idea of a Council of Revision that the decision to vest the veto in the hand of the executive inspired them reopen the question two days later, which they would proceed to do repeatedly over the course of the debates, despite repeated defeats.   Wilson acknowledged that there “was weight” in the observation that judges, in their ordinary capacity, could already defend their own prerogatives through judicial review, yet he insisted that “this power of the judges did not go far enough.” When judges struck down laws, it was only on the basis of their unconstitutionality. “Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive,” Wilson pointed out, “and yet may not be so unconstitutional as to justify the judges in refusing to give them effect.” However, if judges, along with the president, were able to veto laws before they were passed, then they would be able to nullify laws for these other compelling reasons; they would no longer be limited to negating only unconstitutional laws.

Gorham again insisted: “As judges, they are not to be presumed to possess any peculiar knowledge of the mere policy of public measures”; therefore, it should not be deemed their prerogative to judge the laws according to those extraneous considerations, either before or after they were passed. Gerry agreed, and he could hardly suppress his annoyance that this question was again revived after it had already “undergone full discussion.” Involving the judiciary in the making of laws “was making statesmen of the judges, and setting them up as the guardians of the rights of the people.” The job of legislation should be done by the people’s representatives, Gerry said.  \t Ellsworth and Madison both tried to counter the suggestion that judges had no distinctive expertise that might contribute to the crafting of good legislation. Ellsworth insisted that judges “will possess a systematic and accurate knowledge of the laws, which the executive cannot be expected always to possess.” He believed that they would also be peculiarly schooled in the law of nations.

If they were also given the opportunity to join in the veto power, “they will have a double negative” on the laws. Martin then added a fresh reason to reject the motion. “It is necessary,” he insisted, “that the supreme judiciary should have the confidence of the people.

On August 27, William Samuel Johnson proposed that the courts’ jurisdiction should not only include “cases arising under” federal laws, but under “this Constitution” as well. Madison feared that this language might give to the federal judiciary the power to expound the Constitution in cases that were not “of a judiciary nature.” He argued that “the right of expounding the Constitution, in cases not of this nature, ought not to be given to that department.” Once again, Madison was affirming the principle that judges, when they are acting in their capacity as judges, should not be involving themselves in political matters. Their power of expounding the Constitution is limited to the judicial context of deciding criminal proceedings and lawsuits. They should not be giving their opinions about a law (even on the important question of whether or not it was constitutional) outside of that judicial context. Other delegates dismissed Madison’s fear. While agreeing with Madison in principle, they nonetheless believed that the construction of the clause would make it obvious that it related only to cases “of a judiciary nature,” and Johnson’s amendment passed unanimously.

They reveal the Framers’ opinions and presumptions regarding judicial review, a power that has become the Court’s most visible and controversial function. Almost all of the Framers who spoke on the subject argued as if it were a matter of course that judges would have the power to exercise judicial review and strike down federal laws that were unconstitutional. Yet all of the Framers—whether they approved of involving the judiciary in the president’s veto power or they opposed it—were in agreement that, when judges struck down laws in the process of adjudicating, they could only nullify laws on the basis of their constitutionality. Judges, when they are acting in their capacity as judges, have no legitimate say in whether they believe a law is just or unjust, or whether it is sound or foolish policy. Their judgment of a law’s validity is confined only to whether it conforms to the Constitution, and their forum for judging is confined to the ordinary activities of the courtroom.
