1785, Madison wrote to Caleb Wallace: “The Judiciary Department merits every care,” and explicitly commended the court system in Great Britain, because “it maintains private Right against all the corruptions of the two other departments.” Madison gave three reasons to use the British courts as a model: “1. that the Judges should hold their places during good behavior. 2. that their Salaries should be either fixed like the wages of the Representatives or not be alterable so as to affect the Individuals in Office. 3 that their Salaries be liberal.” All three of these features were meant to ensure the independence of judges from the other branches of government.  \t\t The feature of British courts that Madison particularly admired was their independence from the other two branches of the government. In order to ensure that a judge’s interpretation of the laws is impartial, it is imperative that the two political branches of the government—the legislative and executive departments—have no means of unduly influencing a judge’s decision. Of the three requirements that Madison listed, the first two—that judges should hold their offices during good behavior and should receive a fixed salary—were both meant to safeguard that independence. The third requirement—that the judges’ salary be liberal—was only meant to ensure that the job of being a judge did not pay less than that of being a lawyer. Nonetheless, if Madison had to choose between these two benefits—either procuring a judge’s independence or ensuring that a judge’s salary be superior to that of lawyers—it became clear throughout the Convention debates that he believed that safeguarding the judge’s independence was the more important goal. His calculations on this issue, however, failed to win general support.

The New Jersey and Hamilton Plans validated this choice by offering up similar language—identical, in fact, in the New Jersey Plan.   On July 18, disputes arose, however, when the delegates again considered the clause: that “no increase or diminution [of the judges’ salaries] shall be made so as to affect the persons actually in office at the time.” Gouverneur Morris wanted “to strike out ‘no increase.’ He thought the legislature ought to be at liberty to increase salaries, as circumstances might require; and that this would not create any improper dependence in the judges.” Franklin agreed. Inflation could wreak havoc on a salary that was unable to rise with it. Madison admitted that allowing for “increase” alone would create less of a dependence between the branches than would be the case if Congress were permitted both to raise and to lower the judges’ salaries, but he still thought that there was too much potential for impropriety even with that power alone.

He thought that they could arrange matters so that any increase in salaries did not affect the judges who were already serving. Morris thought otherwise. He rejected the notion that there could be found anything of “permanent value.” He rightly observed that, as societies grow richer, the value of basic commodities falls relative to the average income. “The amount of salaries,” he argued, “must always be regulated by the manners and the style of living in a country.” Most of the delegates were convinced, because they voted, 6-to-2, to strike out the prohibition against raising a judge’s salary. After making that change, the clause was passed unanimously.

Morris again opposed it, giving the same arguments he had used previously. George Mason offered a spirited defense of the motion. Even if fixing the salary to some commodity was imperfect, they could compensate for any imperfections by arranging salary hikes so that they did not affect judges who were already in office. General Pinckney countered that would only make matters worse, since it would mean that junior judges would get paid more than senior judges. In order to attract “men of the first talents,” they would need to offer generous salaries, “larger than the United States can afford in the first instance.” Madison’s attempt to reinstate the prohibition against increasing the judges’ salaries was a bust: only Virginia voted in its favor. Consequently, the Constitution places no bar to raising the judges’ salaries, but salaries may not be diminished. Most of the Framers seemed satisfied that this expedient would ensure sufficient independence in the judicial branch.

During the whole of the Convention, not a single voice or a single vote deviated from the original proposal to make the judges’ term “during good behaviour.” The only question to arise on this issue was the dispute over the best way to remove a judge if his behavior was not “good.”  Elbridge Gerry started the discussion of this subject on August 20, when he suggested that a committee (one that had already been appointed) be instructed to report on “a mode of trying the supreme judges in cases of impeachment.” At this stage in the Convention it had already been determined that the trial of all other impeachments would take place in the Supreme Court, so some other body would be needed to try Supreme Court judges after they were impeached. Two days later, the committee reported that “judges of the Supreme Court shall be triable by the Senate, on impeachment by the House of Representatives.” Eventually, the Framers (after stipulating that a conviction would require two-thirds of the Senate) would decide that this would be the mode by which all federal officials would be impeached and tried.

Dickinson’s motion was not a radical idea at the time. Several state constitutions had established courts in which judges served for “good behavior,” yet these same judges were also subject to a precipitous removal process known as “address.” This removal process sometimes required no more than a simple vote in the legislature. Some states involved both the legislative and the executive departments in this process or required a supermajority in both branches of the legislature, but other states made it very easy to remove judges. Dickinson’s home state of Delaware had one of the most effortless modes of removing judges: by a simple vote of only the General Assembly.

He “thought it a contradiction in terms, to say that the judges should hold their offices during good behavior, and yet be removeable without a trial. Besides, it was fundamentally wrong to subject judges to so arbitrary an authority.” Rutledge pointed out another difficulty: The Supreme Court would sometimes be called upon “to judge between the United States and particular states.” If all federal judges, including Supreme Court judges, could be so readily replaced by Congress and the president, then the Supreme Court could never be trusted to judge impartially between the state and federal governments. All of these objections could be reduced to one simple concern over preserving the independence of the three branches of government. As Randolph argued, it would be “weakening too much the independence of the judges,” something that they all agreed was a necessary feature of good government. When Dickinson’s motion came up for a vote, only Connecticut voted in favor of the change.

But their discussions also revealed a good deal about what they expected from the body that would be selected: the federal judges whose appointments (however made) might last a lifetime. The Virginia Plan had proposed that members of the judiciary would “be chosen by the National Legislature.” It is not clear why that mode was first proposed, since almost no one, including Madison, seemed to favor it. When the subject was first debated on June 5, the proposal that the whole legislature select judges was immediately assailed. Wilson argued that “intrigue, partiality, and concealment” were always the result when large bodies were entrusted with a choice of this consequence. He preferred to vest the selection of judges in a single person, and the chief executive would be the best person for the job. Madison agreed that numerous bodies were subject to all the objections that Wilson named, but he also disliked an appointment by the executive. \t When no person or body was brought forward as obviously suited for selecting the ablest judges, the Committee of the Whole merely postponed the question. In June, at the urging of Madison, the delegates decided briefly to vest the power of appointing judges in the hands of the Senate, but the clause was reconsidered by the Convention on July 18, when Gorham expressed his misgivings about the Senate’s capacity to make the best choice. Although the Senate was preferable to the whole House, “he thought even that branch too numerous, and too little personally responsible, to insure a good choice.” He suggested the mode that had worked so well in his own state of Massachusetts: “that the judges be appointed by the executive, with the advice and consent of the second branch.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_663","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_663","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_664","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_664","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1001","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1001","title":"Due Process of Law ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_935","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_935","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_936","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_936","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_678","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_678","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide60536","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Selection of Judges","thumbnail":"dr/Slide60536_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si60570","si60572","Text_Caption_977","Text_Caption_1001","Image_935","Image_936"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide60536"}}},{"id":"si60650","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si60652","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_299","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_299","title":"Judges: Salary, Tenure, and Selection ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_180","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_180","title":"Competing Concerns: Quality and Geographic Diversity ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_979","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_979","title":"Before the delegates had an opportunity to debate Gorham’s proposal, Wilson proposed instead that the judges be appointed by the executive alone, and the Convention proceeded to consider those two alternatives: a choice by the Senate or by the executive. In addition to the question they had already been considering—which body would most likely make a fit choice for the requisite qualifications for a judge—the Framers also began to evince a concern that the judges who were ultimately selected must represent a true geographic diversity. The Connecticut Compromise had moved the ground of the debate; now, a choice by the Senate meant a choice by a majority of states rather than a majority of citizens. Luther Martin thought that the Senate would make the best choice, because its members were “taken from all the states.” Mason likewise began to foresee a problem with geographical constriction if the executive were to make all the judicial appointments. By remaining at “the seat of government” for a considerable period, the executive “would insensibly form local and personal attachments,” and his choice of nominations would likely only fall on those persons he knew. Good candidates from other parts of the country would be neglected. \t Nobody denied that judges ought to come from various locales, but the debate above shows that there was some disagreement about the best mode for guaranteeing geographic diversity. The Supreme Court would sometimes be asked to decide cases that pitted the interests of particular states or regions against each other. If all the judges were from a concentrated region or only particular states, then there would always be a cloud of suspicion (whether or not the suspicion was justified) that the courts’ decisions were not impartial.

Madison began to see the advantages of Gorham’s suggestion for a choice that involved the joint wisdom of two branches of government in selecting the third. Even if an appointment by the executive were to require “the concurrence of one third at least of the second branch,” this mode “would unite the advantage of responsibility in the executive, with the security afforded in the second branch against any incautious or corrupt nomination by the executive.” Those who wanted to exclude the executive from any involvement in the selection process tended to deny that there were any advantages to be gained from an appointment by a single individual. Sherman argued that the Senate “would be composed of men nearly equal to the executive,” and when they pooled their collective talents and information, they would have “more wisdom” than a single executive. Gunning Bedford thought that “the responsibility of the executive, so much talked of, was chimerical,” because his bad choices could in no way be punished. Gorham held firm to his position that the choice by a single individual was more responsible: “He did not mean that he would be answerable under any other penalty than that of public censure, which with honorable minds was a sufficient one.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_667","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_667","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_668","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_668","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1011","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1011","title":"Nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_946","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_946","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_947","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_947","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1012","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1012","title":"Sotomayor Confirmation Hearings ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_948","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_948","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_952","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_952","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_684","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_684","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_685","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_685","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide60696","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Uniting the Advantages of the Executive and the Legislative","thumbnail":"dr/Slide60696_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si60788","si60790","Text_Caption_983","Text_Caption_1011","Image_946","Image_947","Text_Caption_1012","Image_948","Image_952"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide60696"}}},{"id":"si60917","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_301","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_301","title":"Judges: Salary, Tenure, and Selection ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_183","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_183","title":"Who can find the best Judges?

Madison tried for a slight alteration to Gorham’s motion: that the executive nominate the judges and the Senate would have the opportunity to veto the choice with a two-thirds dissent. Although it was Madison who had initially proposed that the Senate should choose the judges, he had clearly been won over by the mode of selection suggested by Gorham (perhaps because the Senate now represented the states equally).

Morris agreed with Madison and Gorham that the executive would have better information about characters, but Charles Pinckney, Ellsworth, and Gerry all gave it as their opinion that the Senate would have the most comprehensive knowledge of the proper characters for the federal judges. Members also disputed whether giving the power to confirm in the Senate—especially if it required a two-thirds majority to overturn the president’s choice—would offer any real security against bad appointments from the executive. Ellsworth believed that the Senate’s “right to supersede his nomination will be ideal only. A nomination under such circumstances will be equivalent to an appointment.” And Mason argued that even if the Senate could reject the nomination with a simple majority, “the appointment was substantially vested in” the executive. He worried that the Senate would be too yielding to “the first nominations” of the executive. By the end of the day’s debates, the naysayers had their way. Gorham’s suggestion, which had been modified by Madison, went down to defeat, 3-to-6; and the Senate was once again entrusted with the job of selecting judges, 6-to-3.

On August 23 it was decided to send the clause which granted the Senate some of its most important powers to a committee for revision. On September 4, the Committee of Postponed Matters recommended the mode of selection that had already been rejected more than once in the Convention: the president should nominate, and “by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint … judges of the Supreme Court.” When the clause was debated on September 7, there were some dissenters, but there was surprisingly little debate. Clearly, the Framers wanted to decide the remaining business quickly and go home.  \t When the Committee’s proposal came up for a vote, the Framers unanimously accepted it. The president, they believed, was the most “national” officeholder; he would be least swayed by geographical prejudices; and he could be expected to know “fit characters” from all over the union. Yet the Framers recognized that there was always a danger when placing so much power in the hands of any single person: he might misuse this authority to reward cronies or to trade favors. For this reason, the Senate was joined in the appointment. And the Senate’s role in this business was by no means an afterthought nor was this body meant to act as a rubber stamp; indeed, there were always far more advocates for a choice by the Senate alone than by the president alone. A concurrence by the senators was meant to ensure that the president’s choice was guided by no other motive than a concern that “fit characters,” taken from geographically diverse parts of the country, sit on the bench of the high court.

He attempted to have Justice Samuel Chase removed, on grounds that he allowed political bias to interfere with his judgments. In 1804, the House successfully impeached Chase, but the Senate voted to acquit in 1805. This experience led an embittered Jefferson to write that the impeachment of judges “is scarcely a scarecrow”; it “is a bugbear which they fear not at all.” No other federal judge has since been impeached for any reason other than legal or ethical misconduct, and no other Supreme Court judge has since been impeached for any reason whatsoever.  Hamilton, however, had never relied on the impeachment power to solve the potential problem of judicial impropriety. He argued that the judiciary’s inherent weakness could be relied on to check its overreach:  The judiciary... has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments. (Federalist No. 78)  Therefore, Hamilton anticipated that the judicial branch “can never attack with success either of the other two”—at least it could not succeed without their implicit cooperation. In other words, the checks and balances of the three branches of government will only work if each branch possesses the will and the ability to resist incursions by the others.
