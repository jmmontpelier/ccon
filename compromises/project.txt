The moral outrage which these compromises provoke is no doubt one of the reasons why, in many of the accounts of the Constitutional Convention, the Framers are portrayed as being more heartless and morally indifferent toward slavery than in fact they were. For instance, it is not uncommon to read that the Framers expressed little or no moral qualms about slavery during these debates. This characterization, however, is far from the truth, as a review of the Convention debates related to slavery reveals. The language used by many of the Framers to describe slavery and the slave trade expressed the strongest moral condemnation; they employed such words as: evil, unjust, wrong, oppressive, dishonorable, ashamed, horror, cruel, unhappy, miserable, wretched, nefarious, infernal, and iniquitous. Language both moral and religious was used to inveigh against slavery. Domestic slavery “was the curse of heaven on the states where it prevailed,” and slaveholders “bring the judgment of Heaven on a country…. By an inevitable chain of causes and effects, Providence punishes national sins by national calamities.” The Framers did not mince words when they spoke about their opposition to slavery. In some cases, the Constitution’s Framers had no choice but to confront the existence of slavery within the states, but many were careful when crafting the Constitution’s wording to try to minimize the suggestion that there was any legitimacy in the institution.

Instead, the Framers resorted to such noncommittal circumlocutions as, “other Persons,” “such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit,” and a “Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof.”   Similar verbal scruples informed the wording the last clause, which became known as the fugitive slave clause. The original wording stated that fugitive slaves “shall be delivered up to the person justly claiming their service or labor” (emphasis added). Some members must have objected to the notion that slaveholders had a “just” claim to their slaves, because this formulation was changed in the Committee of Style. The word justly was dropped, and the phrase, “No person legally held to service or labour . . .” was added. But even that wording seemed to some members to endorse the slaveowners’ claims too much. Finally, on September 15: “the term ‘legally’ was struck out; and the words ‘under the laws thereof,’ inserted . . . in compliance with the wish of some who thought the term legal equivocal, and favoring the idea that slavery was legal in a moral view.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_698","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_698","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_699","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_699","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1078","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1078","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1079","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1079","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide66003","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Avoiding the Word","thumbnail":"dr/Slide66003_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si66200","si66202","Text_Caption_1100","Image_1078","Image_1079"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide66003"}}},{"id":"si71584","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si71586","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_346","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_346","title":"The Slavery Compromises ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_217","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_217","title":"Perspectives and Disagreements on Slavery by the Framers ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_700","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_700","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_701","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_701","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1185","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1185","title":"Slave Market in Richmond, Virginia.

Although there were some delegates who held strong anti-slavery views, others, even some from the Northeast, spoke with indifference about the evils of slavery. The members from Virginia were strongly opposed to slavery in principle, but they also acknowledged that they—as representatives of their state and the South as a whole—must demand protections for the institution in the Constitution. And finally, there were also members from the Deep South who could fairly be described as unabashedly pro-slavery. The simple truth was that the United States was a deeply divided people on this subject at this time. The real question underlying modern criticisms of the Framers, then, is not, “why is it that the Framers did not express the strongest moral outrage over slavery?” (some did), but rather, “why did their outrage accomplish so little toward righting the country’s deepest wrongs?” Phraseology is all well and good, but it is poor consolation to any person who is enslaved and treated like property.

It is revealing, then, to contrast today’s critics of the Constitution to the attacks launched by the Constitution’s first detractors. During the ratification debates, many Antifederalists criticized the Constitution because it allowed the continuance of the slave trade for 20 more years, or because slaves were counted in the representation for Congress, or because of the sly wording used to describe slavery in the Constitution.  One Antifederalist, writing under the name Brutus, objected: “What a strange and unnecessary accumulation of words are here used to conceal from the public eye” the persons who were being described by the three-fifths clause.  There were numerous critics of the Constitution when it emerged from the Convention, but few at the time faulted the Framers for failing to place slavery on the road to extinction, even though there was a growing abolitionist movement in several states. (Two of the Constitution’s Framers, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton, were active members in their own state’s abolitionist societies.) These anti-slavery societies, however, had hoped at most that the new Constitution would put an immediate end to further importation of slaves from Africa.  They did not expect that the Constitutional Convention would be able to find a solution to the problem of slavery as a whole.  Consequently, the way that people judge the Framers’ successes or failures with regards to slavery can depend very much on the level of expectations that they bring to the question.  Critics today are more likely to believe that the Framers could have found a solution to the slavery problem, if only they had exerted more political will.  Abolitionist critics in 1787 and 1788 had generally not believed that such an outcome was possible.

Many Southerners were willing to concede that slavery was evil, but that moral objection did nothing to diminish the enormous interests aimed at protecting the slaveowner’s property and way of life.   As a member of Virginia’s Assembly, Madison had personally witnessed how proposals for a plan of gradual abolition in his state had been met with outrage by the slaveholding interests.  By the time of the Convention, it had been only five years since Virginia had passed a law which for the first time made it legal for a slaveowner to voluntarily manumit his own slave without special permission from the government.  Madison predicted that even this right would be taken away or curtailed if abolitionist forces pushed too far or too fast in Virginia.

Faced with this reality, residents from these states had grown hardened, and sometimes even zealously committed, to making slavery a permanent institution in the South.  Within the Constitutional Convention, delegates from South Carolina and Georgia threatened to pack up and go home if the Constitution so much as encroached on their right of importing fresh slaves from Africa.  They insisted that, even if they used all their influence back home, the states of Georgia and South Carolina would never accept a Constitution that would put an abrupt halt to slave importations.  If the Deep South reacted in this way when some delegates insisted only that the African slave trade should be abolished, proposals of general abolition were out of the question.  A sea change in the political and economic conditions of the South would have to take place before its political leaders (or their constituents) felt that they were ready to take practical steps toward abolition.

Only a very few of the Framers (to say nothing of the population at large) had wanted a central government which had control over the internal affairs of each state. Quite apart from question of slavery, many delegates, and principally from the Northern States, had insisted that the Constitution should include special protections that would keep the central government from interfering with the “police powers” of the states (those powers that related to the welfare of persons and property within the borders of the state).

What enriches a part enriches the whole, and the states are the best judges of their particular interest.” Similarly, Elbridge Gerry “thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the states as to slaves”; he was only anxious that the national Constitution did not “give any sanction to it.” In these speeches, Ellsworth and Gerry were trying to urge their colleagues to refrain from interfering with the African slave trade (which many others had argued was a decidedly national object). But there seemed to be a tacit understanding, both within and without the Convention, that the institution of slavery was an issue belonging to each state individually. It would not be until after the Constitution was ratified that some abolitionists began to see the potential for tackling the problem of slavery as a national movement.

There were some Northerners who indulged in a naïve optimism that slavery was on the long road to extinction even without any extraordinary efforts, and that optimism was not wholly without foundation. The Framers had witnessed a dramatic shift in national sentiment against slavery since the Revolution. Massachusetts had declared slavery incompatible with its state constitution and abolished it within its borders in 1783.  Many other northern and middle states had passed laws for gradual emancipation, and they could look forward to a slave-free population within a few decades.  Even in Virginia, there were rumors in 1785 that abolition was imminent (alas, these rumors proved to be scare-mongering tactics of pro-slavery forces, but the rumor was believed in other states).  And during that same summer when the Convention was meeting, the Confederation Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, which banned slavery within the Northwestern Territories.  Seen in retrospect, 1787 could be seen as the high-water mark for a diffusive antislavery sentiment in America.  The tide was about to turn, however, and pro-slavery forces in the South would grow ever more belligerent and demanding in their protection of the institution.  But people in 1787 had no way to know what was coming.

Provision is already made in Connecticut for abolishing it. And the abolition has already taken place in Massachusetts.” He therefore urged his colleagues not to “intermeddle” with each state’s policies regarding the slave trade. Similarly, James Wilson had triumphantly declared in the Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention that the new power to prohibit the slave trade in 1808 would lay “the foundation for banishing slavery out of this country.” Some Founders, then, might have complacently accepted a Constitution that effectively continued slavery as the status quo within the states because they naïvely expected that most of the states would eventually act to eliminate slavery. Southern delegates were more appreciative of the herculean efforts that would be required to extinguish slavery below the Mason-Dixon Line, but they were in no hurry to disabuse their more optimistic neighbors to the North.

In some cases (such as a census which based representation and certain taxes on population), the Constitution was forced to acknowledge the existence of slavery within the states and to compromise with that fact. In one case (the 20-year compromise), there was a concerted effort to ameliorate the existing circumstances. And in one case (the fugitive slave clause), there was a clear protection given to slaveholders. The Constitution as written, however, offered very little hope that the federal government would ever place the institution of slavery on the road to extinction.  \t Future abolitionists might seek encouragement from other clauses that were formed with little or no reference to slavery (such as Congress’ power to “make all needful rules and regulations” in US territories or the guarantee of a republican form of government in each state), but these were either modest or far-fetched hopes. For the most part, while some strong rhetoric was used to describe the evils of slavery, the Constitution’s Framers had left the condition of slavery much as they had found it under the Articles of Confederation: a matter for each state to resolve on its own. Slavery simply was not an issue that the Framers were willing to confront at the risk of overthrowing their overall effort.

The Montpelier enslaved community included domestic servants, skilled and craft workers, and field laborers. Domestic servants labored primarily in and around the mansion and nearby outbuildings as cooks, waiters, butlers, maids, laundresses, and gardeners, and likely resided in the South Yard housing complex. Other Montpelier slaves labored as skilled workers, trained in a variety of crafts including carpentry, smithing, and brick-making. Slaves oversaw the operation of a grist mill, sawmill, a whiskey and brandy distillery, and a blacksmith shop. The largest group of slaves at Montpelier was comprised of field slaves. These slaves worked the plantation fields, harvested tobacco, and oversaw livestock.  Archaeological investigations of the enslaved community have focused on three areas: (1) the South Yard for the enslaved domestic servants; (2) the “Log Home,” a part of the service and craft complex located on the south of the mansion yard; and (3) the Tobacco Barn and Field Quarter. The findings from the archaeological excavations can be accessed by clicking on the images to the right.  James Madison was himself deeply conflicted on the institution of slavery, with surviving letters and visitor accounts indicating that he would often talk at great length on the “evils” of the institution. Yet he never freed his slaves, feeling that whites and free blacks could not co-exist. As such, he was an early supporter of the American Colonization Society whose aim was to free slaves and see them returned to Africa.

Identified on a fire insurance map from 1837, the South Yard was comprised of three duplex-homes—or what are referred to as “Dwelling Houses for Servants”—and two smoke houses.  The South Kitchen, built in the mid-18th century is curiously absent, indicating that it was demolished sometime before 1837.  Archaeological investigations have been performed on the Southeast and Southwest Duplex-Homes, as well as preliminary investigations of the eastern smoke house.  These excavations revealed a series of stone and brick foundations on the two duplex-home structures that confirmed their size at 16 feet by 32 feet, or two rooms of 16 feet by 16 feet.  Each structure had a central chimney base, one of which was a classic Rumsford fireplace that provides definitive dating evidence for the South Yard structures—the only other Rumsford fireplace is seen in the wings of the mansion added in 1809-1812. Montpelier has used this evidence to recreate the timber frames of these structures in the South Yard today.  The archaeological excavations also revealed evidence for pipes that were used to transport water to an unknown structure, perhaps a dairy, beyond the South Yard, and of a roasting pit used for preparing barbeque.  Yet the excavations were not just about buildings, water pipes, or roasting pits, but the artifacts that would reveal more about the everyday lives of the enslaved domestic servants that lived and worked in the South Yard and the mansion.

The Stable Quarter lies just beyond the 19th-century formal yard and served as the home for an enslaved artisan household between the mid 1790s through to the 1830s when the structure was abandoned. Unlike the timber-framed structures of the South Yard (built in 1810) with their raised timber floors and central masonry chimney bases, the Stable Quarter was a log cabin with clay floors, at-grade hearths, and stick-and-mud chimneys.  While it might sound to be a much simpler, humbler arrangement than the buildings of the South Yard, in some ways it would have presented a more insulated living arrangement as the cold winter wind would not have whistled underfoot, and the clay-chinked walls would have offered more insulation than the thickness of a single plank of wood. In addition, the sub-floor storage pit found inside the structure would allow the household to store sweet potatoes through the winter—one option not available to inhabitants of structures in the South Yard.  The structure was originally 16 feet by 20 feet, consistent with other structures at Montpelier that have been identified as 18th century (smaller than those in the South Yard).  The archaeological evidence indicates that there were two rooms to the structure, each heated by its own hearth, and perhaps a single window.  Surrounding the Stable Quarter to the north were a number of borrow pits—originally used for the clay to chink the structure and the chimneys.

Initially thought to be two or more separate log homes, the Tobacco Barn actually saw three separate types of activity within its three bays laid side-by-side. In its earliest phase of activity it was used as the name suggests: for the fire curing of tobacco that Madison would sell to factories first in Fredericksburg and then in Richmond. It was also used for short-term worker housing, as represented by the presence of domestic materials and food refuse. Finally, the structure was converted and re-framed to house a modern contrivance: a wheat-threshing machine similar to the one used by his close friend, Thomas Jefferson.  The two structures in the Field Quarter were identified by their sub-floor pits, or rectangular holes excavated into the floor of the structure for storage. Commonly located near fireplaces, these were often referred to as “sweet potato holes,” as warm, dry conditions favored the preservation of the sweet potato of the winter months. The sub-floor pit of both structures had clear evidence for re-use, indicating that the structures had been used over a long period of time.
