The proposed change from the unicameral Congress prescribed by the Articles to the bicameral one in the Virginia Plan meant that the Framers had the opportunity to remake each house into something completely distinct and of their own design.  But what should each house look like?  Older constitutions had introduced the principle of the “mixed regime,” whereby different parts of the government represented different classes of the citizenry.  Examples of mixed regimes could be seen throughout the ancient world, but Britain’s constitution was the form that every American would have been most familiar with.  In Britain’s Parliament, one house (The House of Lords) represented the upper classes and the nobility while the other house (The House of Commons) was meant to represent the lower classes.

There were two distinct rationales for using the bicameral legislature to divide power between the different classes of society—what might be called the “pessimistic view” and the “optimistic view” of a mixed regime.  According to the “pessimistic view,” the rich and the poor form two distinct and opposing interests within society.  If all the power were given to the rich (or oligarchic) part of society, then they would use it to oppress the lower classes and keep them from attaining prosperity or otherwise restrict their personal rights.  On the other hand, if all the power were given to the poor, they would use it to raid the property of the rich and redistribute it amongst themselves.  Therefore, the best arrangement was to give some power to each of the classes, so that each one is able to protect itself from the persecution and rapacity of the other.  This more pessimistic view seeks to balance and check the two destructive impulses that predominate in every society: the selfishness and imperiousness of the rich (the ruling passion in every oligarchy) and the selfishness and envy of the poor (the ruling passion in every democracy).

That’s where the representatives of the great mass of people have something to contribute.  They are in possession of more particular information about the everyday interests and needs of citizens from every quarter of the regime (including the disadvantaged regions).

The optimist view of mixed regimes, on the other hand, sought to capitalize on the advantages of the two good forms of government: harnessing both the aristocratic and the republican elements of society.  Every piece of legislation receives all the benefits of the wisdom, foresight, and stability of the upper (aristocratic) branch, and it benefits from a broad knowledge of the electorate and a vigilant protection for the people’s rights, which is found in the lower (republican) branch.    All of these varying optimistic and pessimistic views—which, at the time, merged into the abstract conceptions of having “upper” and “lower” chambers of Congress—were present during the first days of the Convention, and would be further developed, refined, and complicated as the two branches of the legislature simultaneously adopted the characteristics of federalist and nationalist bodies.

On May 31, the Committee of the Whole debated the fourth resolution of the Virginia Plan, which specified that the first house should be chosen directly by the people.  Elbridge Gerry, whose home state of Massachusetts had recently been almost torn apart by local insurrections, protested that “the evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy.”  The people lacked the virtue necessary for good republican government. Gerry, who took the pessimistic view of mixed regimes was convinced that any new constitution would have to have more oligarchic protections for the rights of property to balance out the excesses of democracy they had experienced within the existing constitutions. \t Mason responded to Gerry with a spirited defense of the positive good to be found in the lower, republican, branch of the legislature.  He “argued strongly for an election of the larger branch by the people.  It was to be the grand depository of the democratic principle of the government.  It was, so to speak, to be our House of Commons.  It ought to know and sympathize with every part of the community.”  A legislature needs the knowledge of and sympathy with the people in order to formulate good laws, and those qualities could only be acquired when there was direct election by the people in the Lower House.  Mason conceded Gerry’s point that “we had been too democratic, but was afraid we should incautiously run into the opposite extreme.  We ought to attend to the rights of every class of the people.”  The problem with some of the state constitutions was that there were too few institutions that could counterbalance the democratic branch of government.  What they needed was to find the right balance, not to tip the scales in the opposite direction.

As he repeated a few days later, he “considered an election of one branch, at least, of the legislature by the people immediately, as a clear principle of free government.”     When the Committee of the Whole voted on popular elections for the Lower House, only six states were in favor of the measure.  New Jersey and South Carolina voted no, and Connecticut and Delaware were divided on the question. The vote of South Carolina was probably influenced by a more elitist and aristocratic political stance than what prevailed in most of the other states.  Even though the committee had voted to have popular elections for the Lower House by a 6-4 majority, Charles Pinckney and John Rutledge of South Carolina reopened the question a few days later, on June 6, in an attempt to do away with popular elections altogether.  They contended “that the people were less fit judges” to make such a choice than the state legislators.  General Pinckney, another South Carolinian, agreed with them: their state’s lawmakers “had some sense of character” (unlike the voters who had put them in office).  Therefore, state legislatures would be better able to select fit members for a national legislature.

Although the motivations behind this rival plan of government were primarily federalist in nature (its advocates wanted to guarantee the equal voice of smaller states and thus proposed to weaken the central government and assert the powers of the state governments), Paterson also defended the Plan on aristocratic grounds.  If they did as the New Jersey Plan proposed, then this new “Congress will act with more energy and wisdom than the proposed national legislature” found in the Virginia Plan, because it was “fewer in number, and more secreted and refined by the mode of elections.” The Convention collectively rejected these arguments.

John Rutledge tried to make his point by appealing to the vanity of his colleagues: “If this Convention had been chosen by the people in districts, it is not to be supposed that such proper characters would have been preferred.”  Since the Convention’s delegates had been chosen by their respective state legislatures, and since the legislatures had done such a fine job of selecting capable men, that was proof of the superiority of this mode of election.  When the question was put to a vote, the same three small states joined South Carolina in the attempt to allow each state to decide how to choose its members to the lower branch, but they were defeated by the six other states (Maryland was divided). Immediately following that vote, the question was put to the Convention for the final time: Should the Lower House be elected by the people?

But the delegates did not immediately agree about the mode of election that would replace that proposal, and “a chasm [was] left in this part of the plan.”  On June 7, the Committee of the Whole debated more fully how the Senate should be selected.  Dickinson recommended that the election of senators should be made directly by the state legislatures.  One of his reasons for this proposal was to promote federalism (because “the sense of the states” would be best captured by having state governments choose federal officials).

The other delegates who argued against Dickinson’s motion primarily did so on nationalistic grounds rather than democratic ones.  Some of the members feared that, if senators were chosen directly by state legislatures, then the Senate would probably pursue the policies of the individual states rather than a national agenda.  Other members saw a selection by state legislatures as a threat to proportional representation in the Upper House.  Their reasoning went like this: If state legislatures chose senators, then each state (however small) would have to have at least one senator.  If each state had at least one senator, and senators were distributed proportionally among the states, then the senate body would be too large to serve the function of an upper house (which was supposed to be a small, elite body that exercised cool deliberation).  For that reason, several individual delegates were opposed to selecting senators by state legislatures.  Yet when the question came up for a vote in the Committee of the Whole, Dickinson’s motion was passed unanimously.   When it was debated in the Convention on June 25, the only serious objection to the proposal seemed to be that it would destroy the proportional representation that the large states were still trying to achieve.  Nonetheless, the election of the senators by state legislatures passed overwhelmingly in the Convention, 9-to-2.

If the Senate were proportioned among the states according to population or wealth, and if the smallest states were represented by even one Senator, then the total number of senators would be too large.  Once the states had agreed to an equal representation in the Senate, fixing the number of senators was not contentious.  Gouverneur Morris proposed on July 23 that each state be allowed three senators, since “he wished the Senate to be a pretty numerous body.”  He had very few supporters in that wish, however.  Other delegates protested that number would make the Senate too large, especially as new states would be added.  When it came up for a vote, only Pennsylvania voted to have three senators from each state.  The counter-suggestion—that each state have two senators—was agreed to unanimously.

It had been decided very early in the Convention and with overwhelming support that the Lower House should be proportioned to the population of each state, counting slaves as three-fifths of all free persons.  The size of that body, then, would depend on how many inhabitants each congressman would represent (for instance, one congressman for every 5,000 residents would result in an enormous body; whereas one congressman for every 100,000 residents would result, like the Senate, in a very small body).  In July, the same committee that recommended the “Great Compromise” (proportioning one house of Congress to the population and making the other house equal among the states) likewise for the first time suggested a precise number for the ratio of the Lower House.  It specified: “That in the 1st. branch of the Legislature each of the States now in the Union shall be allowed 1 member for every 40,000 inhabitants” (factoring in the three-fifths clause that had already been agreed upon and specifying that every state should have at least one representative, even if their population was less than 40,000).    There were some objections to this proposal, but they were primarily from those members who had always wanted to see property factored into the apportionment and not merely population. After some discussion in favor of including property, Williamson reintroduced the rule of population, which included the three-fifths provision for slavery already agreed to in the Committee of the Whole, and added to it a provision that would require a periodic census in order to require Congress to reapportion on a regular basis. The Convention finally decided to readopt the rule tying representation to population alone, including the three-fifths clause.

The future increase of population, if the Union should be permanent, will render the number of representatives excessive.”  Everyone was agreed that this body should be a large one, but still, it was possible to be too large.  With the natural increase in size of the country, the membership would eventually become enormous.  (If that same ratio were in place today, then the House would have nearly 8,000 members).

The other objection related to the number itself; many members thought that the body should be larger than the ratio would allow.  Even Hamilton—who frequently said disparaging things about popular forms of government—agreed.  He said that “he held it essential that the popular branch of [government] should be on a broad foundation.  He was seriously of opinion, that the House of Representatives was on so narrow a scale as to be really dangerous, and to warrant a jealousy in the people for their liberties.”  But this objection came late in the Convention, on September 8, and the Framers were by this time weary of debate.

He said that, owing to his position, he had maintained his silence throughout the Convention, “yet he could not forbear expressing his wish that the alteration proposed might take place.”  Some members had believed that the small size of the representative body was a threat to the rights and interests of the people, and “he acknowledged that it had always appeared to himself among the exceptionable parts of the plan; and, late as the present moment was for admitting amendments, he thought this of so much consequence, that it would give him much satisfaction to see it adopted.”  When the most revered man in the country expresses his personal wish to make a slight alteration for the sake of protecting the rights of the people, he does not speak in vain.  The Convention exchanged the 40,000 figure for 30,000, and they did so unanimously and without a murmur of protest.

Most states had lower houses in which members served for only one year; Rhode Island’s charter prescribed that their representatives were subject to elections every six months.  Such frequent elections (and the mutable laws that resulted) had convinced many Americans that it was possible for representatives to be too responsive to the changing wishes of their constituents.  Many of the Framers wished to correct these errors in the state constitutions, yet they were no less committed than their forebears to avoiding offices that were too aristocratic.

He was as much against a triennial house, as against an hereditary executive.”  Gerry may have misread the feelings of his compatriots when he spoke on behalf of the feelings of the whole “people of New England”; in any event, seven of the non-New England states voted for triennial elections, and even a couple of members from Massachusetts were inclined toward this length of term.    Nevertheless, the Convention later thought better of such a radical departure from the states’ practice, and on June 21 they reconsidered the three-year proposal adopted by the Committee.  Edmund Randolph suggested they replace triennial elections with biannual ones.  “He was sensible that annual elections were a source of great mischiefs in the states,” but their main problem was not the popular branch itself; rather, what they needed were firmer checks from the other branches.  Any radical changes in the length of terms should be concentrated in the Upper House.

Hamilton argued that every society is divided into the few and the many:  “Give all power to the many, they will oppress the few.  Give all power to the few, they will oppress the many.  Both, therefore, ought to have the power, that each may defend itself against the other.”  He later clarified that it was the “inequality of property [that] constituted the great and fundamental distinction in society.”  And since “one branch of the proposed government was so formed as to render it particularly the guardians of the poorer orders of citizens,” the other should be formed to safeguard the interests of the rich.

Madison favored the longer term, but others, including a convincing Roger Sherman, thought that four or six years was sufficient for providing “steadiness and wisdom” in the Senate, and the others must have agreed.

Over the course of the debates, the delegates considered lodging these powers in the legislature as a whole, in the Senate by itself, by the president alone, and finally, by the president with the “advice and consent of the Senate.”  This last mode was designed to combine the unity, decision, and dispatch of a single magistrate with the collective wisdom of the more elite branch of the legislature.

Although the Upper House was singled out to exercise some of the most influential privileges, one power was given more particularly to the Lower House: “All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.”  The debates surrounding the power to originate money bills revealed most plainly the conflicting opinions among the members about what the character of each of the two houses was meant to be.

But should the same reasoning hold true in America, where there was no class of nobility?  Prior to the Convention, Madison and his cohorts evidently believed that their cases were decidedly different, because the Virginia Plan specified that “each branch ought to possess the right of originating Acts” without naming any exclusions.  On June 13, while the members were still sitting in the Committee of the Whole, Elbridge Gerry moved to limit the power of originating money bills to the Lower House; they were “more immediately the representatives of the ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1315","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1315","title":"people, and it was a maxim, that the people ought to hold the purse-strings.”  Gerry’s pessimistic view of pitting the rich against the poor in the two branches of the legislature was countered by others who held more optimistic hopes for the Senate.  Pierce Butler complained that they “were always following the British constitution, when the reason of it did not apply.  There was no analogy between the House of Lords and the body proposed to be established.”  The American Senate was designed to be filled by “the best men,” and that sort “would be apt to decline serving in it” if the delegates framed a body that was “degraded by any such discriminations.”  Madison agreed.  Whatever the reason for excluding the House of Lords from this privilege (and commentators were not even agreed on the reason for it in Britain), it was certain that “there could be no similar reason in the case before us.  The Senate would be the representatives of the people as well as the first branch.”  The American Upper House would not be a place carved out for the rich or the nobility; rather, according to Madison, “the Senate would be generally a more capable set of men,” and as such, “it would be wrong to disable them from” the most important powers, and bills raising revenue were certainly among the most important of powers.

Many members from the large states—such as Morris, Wilson, and Madison—did not think the concession was a very meaningful one for the large states. Other members, however, from both the large and the small states, believed that the exclusion was a good idea, even when considered independently of the larger question of an apportionment compromise between the states.  And a third set of members believed that, because of the compromise, the distinction would be necessary in order to protect the interests of the large states from an undue influence of the small states in the Senate. \t There was fierce debate on all sides of the question, and those who favored limiting the intuition of revenue bills to the lower house were more vehement in their insistence, and so the right of originating money bills was therefore lodged exclusively in the House. But the reasons for including this measure differed significantly among the Framers.  Some voted for it as a safeguard for the rights of the people against the wealthy and elite, others because it was a safeguard for the larger states against the smaller, and still more because they were simply being conciliatory to one or the other of the first two groups.

But upon the objections of George Mason, who was disinclined to trust the affairs of state to someone who was too young to enter into a legal contract, it was decided to fix the minimum age of representatives to 25 years.  The Upper House, of course, required more maturity and wisdom.  From the first, the Committee of the Whole proposed a 30-year age requirement, and that age passed muster within both the Committee and the Convention without disputation.   \t The citizenship and residency requirements provoked a little more discussion, but these issues were still far less controversial when applied to the legislature than when they applied to the executive.  In general, the Framers wanted to be liberal-minded about opening the pathways to public service for deserving immigrants, but at the same time they wanted to ensure that legislators had sufficient time to acquire information about local circumstances and to adopt loyalties toward their constituencies before embarking on the important task of representing a district or state.  This latter consideration was especially important for senators, who would be involved in approving treaties with foreign countries.  Without too much dissent, it was decided that congressmen were required to be an American citizen for seven years and senators for nine years before election; both were required simply to be inhabitants of the state from which they were elected.

On June 26, General Pinckney suggested that senators should serve without receiving a salary, and he gave a pessimistic rationale for his suggestion:  “As this (the senatorial) branch was meant to represent the wealth of the country, it ought to be composed of persons of wealth; and if no allowance was to be made, the wealthy alone would undertake the service.”  Benjamin Franklin seconded this motion, but for different reasons.  He wanted the national offices to attract none but the most public spirited; he feared creating offices that would attract men who were motivated by the combined vices of ambition and avarice.  Pinckney’s motion lost when it came to a vote, but it was a close call at 6-to-5.  By an equally close vote, it was decided that the senators’ salaries should be paid out of the national treasury rather than the states’ coffers. Madison explained that he did not want senators who were beholden to their respective states for their pay; instead, he wanted senators who were “impartial umpires and guardians of justice and the ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1322","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1322","title":"general good.” Receiving pay from the national government would reinforce the notion that this branch was to serve national interests, not state interests.  Nonetheless, those members who wanted to design the Senate to be the branch which represented the wealthy sought new means to do it.  George Mason first started the idea on June 26 that, since “one important object in constituting the Senate was, to secure the rights of property,” then it would make sense that there should be “a qualification of property” in order to hold that office.  A month later he made a formal motion to that effect, suggesting that the Committee of Detail should be instructed to formulate property and citizenship qualifications for the legislators.  Gouverneur Morris replied that, if they were to enumerate property qualifications, “he would prefer them in the electors, rather than the elected.” John Dickinson was opposed to instituting any property qualification in the electorate:  “He doubted the policy of interweaving into a republican constitution a veneration for wealth.  He had always understood that a veneration for poverty and virtue were the objects of republican encouragement.”  Rejecting altogether the pessimists’ aim of creating an oligarchic Senate, he wanted the offices open to “any man of merit,” since “merit was understood to form the great title to public trust, honors, and rewards.”  Nonetheless, eight states agreed to allow the Committee to suggest some manner of property qualifications.

Although Pinckney had previously emphasized the great equality that existed in America, on this occasion he showed his oligarchic colors; he said that if he were going to devise these qualifications, “he should not think of less than one hundred thousand dollars for the President, half of that sum for each of the judges, and in like proportion for the members of the national legislature.”  These amounts would limit the offices to men who were fairly wealthy at the time.

A republic may be converted into an aristocracy or oligarchy, as well by limiting the number capable of being elected as the number authorized to elect.”  The Convention voted 7-to-3 not to give that power to Congress.  John Rutledge tried to salvage the idea of property qualifications in the federal offices by tying them to whatever each state set for its own state offices.  That idea would remove the two difficulties, but the Convention was ready to abandon altogether the idea of requiring property qualifications in order to serve in either branch of Congress.

Over the course of the summer, the delegates came to see the Senate as the guardian of state prerogatives (the federal branch) and the House as the depository of the common national interest (the national branch).  Nonetheless, the delegates also retained the predisposition to regard the Senate as the “upper branch” and the House of Representatives as the “lower branch.”  And even among the many delegates who agreed that a bicameral legislature should have upper and lower chambers, these designations sprang from varying viewpoints.  The “pessimistic” view held that the Senate should represent the interests of the rich and the House should represent the interests of the poor; whereas the “optimistic” view held that the Senate should embody the dispassionate judgment of the wise, educated, elder statesmen while the House embodied the republican spirit of the common people who would be vigilant about their liberties.  So, during the rough and tumble of the debates, which features won out? \t The “federalist” character of the Senate was established and maintained by allowing each state an equal number of senators and allowing state legislatures to choose their own senators.  The “national” character of the House was maintained by apportioning the number of representatives to the populations of each state and having the representatives popularly elected within congressional districts.  (The Constitution does not explicitly mandate congressional districts within states, but most of the Framers seemed to assume that states would assign geographical districts to their respective congressmen, and most states did in fact arrange matters in this way from the beginning and throughout America’s history.)  The “national” character of both houses was further emphasized by having each house draw its salary from the national treasury rather than from the state treasuries.

In order to attract and select a body of men who would serve as “elite” members of society, the Framers devised several features that would come to characterize a classical Senate body.  Senators would serve longer terms than any legislative body then existing in America, and those terms would be staggered.  These two features would give the Senate more independence and stability than the other legislative branch.  Senators would be elected by state legislatures, and many believed that this democratic “filtration” would ensure a wiser choice of lawgivers.  The Senate was given a share in a couple of the most important powers (appointments and treaty-making), which would both attract better men and demand more from them.  And the Senate would be a smaller body, which would foster more cool deliberation, and no man could be a senator until he had been a citizen at least nine years and had reached the mature age of 30.   \t On the other hand, the Framers contrived the House to fulfill its republican function as a “Lower House” by designing it as a middle ground between some of the excessively democratic legislative bodies found in the states and the more elitist body of the Senate.  Its two-year term gave it more independence than it would have if it were annually elected, yet it would still be more responsive to the people than the three-year terms they were considering.  The districts from which congressmen would be chosen would be large enough to guarantee that respectable characters would be elected yet small enough (starting at one for every 30,000 people) that the people’s will would be sufficiently represented in a large body of representatives.

Three specific suggestions were made to guarantee that the Upper House would reflect the interests of the rich—that its members would have high property qualifications, that they would serve for life, or that they would serve without pay—and all three failed to win assent.  Only one other provision even touched on this consideration.  John Dickinson had suggested that, if Senators were chosen by state legislatures, then they would be more likely to choose men “distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property.”  But this consideration was far outweighed by the other reasons given (by Dickinson as well as others) for leaving the choice of Senators in the hands of the state legislators.  On the other hand, the construction of the Lower House had a couple of decidedly democratic characteristics to protect the interests of the poor.  The Constitution required no property qualifications for suffrage to the Lower House; instead, qualifications were tied to the most liberal construction in each state.  And the Lower House would have the exclusive privilege of originating money bills, which placed the power of the purse in the hands of the people at large.
