Edmund Randolph gave his speech introducing the Virginia Plan on May 29, he tried to be diplomatic about Virginia’s choice to reject the Articles of Confederation wholesale: “In speaking of the defects of the Confederation, he professed a high respect for its authors, and considered them as having done all that patriots could do, in the then infancy of the science of constitutions and of confederacies.” These pioneering authors, Randolph went on to explain, simply did not have the benefit of hindsight; they had no way of knowing the sort of design flaws that would emerge, and plague them, as a result of this style of confederacy. Randolph attempted to tread on this subject with some delicacy, since the primary author of the Articles, John Dickinson, was among the assembly listening to him enumerate its defects. For all of Randolph’s respect for the Articles and its authors, however, it was undeniable that the Virginia Plan that he proposed seemed to depart from its example in almost every particular. During the debates that followed, several members tried to alter its resolutions so that it aligned more closely with the Articles, usually (but not always) without success.

The Framers had generally agreed that the Articles had been deeply flawed, yet they had no wish to toss out the baby with the bathwater. The first half of the Convention had been dominated by a rift between those who wanted to scrap the Articles entirely and those who wanted to retain many of its most important features. By mid-July, however, the Connecticut Compromise had worked out a truce on the single most contentious issue dividing the two factions: creating a Senate that would resemble the old Congress and a House that would be established on an entirely new principle of representation. Two weeks after this compromise, the Committee of Detail set to work salvaging several more of the Articles’ best features.  \t They snipped off a number of its clauses—some of greater and some of lesser importance—pruning the healthiest branches from the old compact and grafting them onto the new vine of the Constitution. The report that they delivered on August 6 included several provisions that had not yet been discussed in the Convention but which would have been familiar to all of the delegates, because they had already been operating under them as a part of the old confederacy. Most of the provisions that the Committee had selected to purloin from the Articles were ultimately adopted in some form, and often with very little debate.

These states were not quite like foreign countries with international borders dividing them, yet they were also not fully united like the people of one country. On the one hand, each state had sovereign authority over its own internal affairs, so their respective laws could be very different from one another; on the other hand, citizens were expected to move freely—either temporarily or permanently—across state borders. The Articles had therefore included several specific provisions to promote that unique relationship of comity, and one such provision was for the rendition of fugitives from justice. At the Constitutional Convention, the Committee of Detail added a rendition clause to their report that was very similar to the one found in the Articles. During the debate over this clause in the Convention on August 28, it passed with few changes. Yet during the discussion, Pierce Butler and Charles Pinckney first brought forward the idea that fugitive slaves and indentured servants ought likewise “to be delivered up like criminals.” The discussion of the fugitive slave clause took place later, and its placement in Article IV of the Constitution is a distinct clause separate from the rendition clause, but the idea was first spawned during the discussion of recovering fugitives from justice.

In this case, the Framers chose to pare down the wording from its original formulation in the Articles. The original clause had been prefaced with a sort of preamble all its own: “The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this Union,” it began, each state would extend the same “privileges and immunities” to members of other states that they granted to their own citizens. The Framers dropped the language about friendship between the states, but they also made another decision that had the effect of actually extending the friendship to a greater number of people. The original clause had excluded “paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice” from this guarantee of equal privileges and immunities, yet the Constitution gives no ground for excluding people on the basis of poverty or homelessness. Article IV, Section 2, of the Constitution—which was adopted without change from the Committee of Detail’s report—simply states: “The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” When the delegates discussed this clause, the only comment came from General Pinckney, who “was not satisfied with it. He seemed to wish some provision should be included in favor of property in slaves.” The General was probably thinking of protecting the property rights of slaveowners in those circumstances when they brought their slaves from their home states into free states or federal territories. Whatever he may have meant, however, the subject was not taken up again, leaving future generations to wonder what the full extent of “privileges and immunities” might mean.

On August 29, Hugh Williamson said that he preferred the language in the Articles, since he could not understand what might be intended by the requirement that one state had to give “full faith” to another state’s laws. Others replied that it might be necessary for one state to honor the rules of bankruptcies in other states. Charles Pinckney then suggested that perhaps the language of the “full faith and credit” clause should be reconsidered, yet at the same time a separate clause might be added providing for “uniform laws upon the subject of bankruptcies.” It was agreed that they should commit these questions. Gouverneur Morris then added that, in addition to the other amendments under consideration, a separate provision should be added to the “full faith and credit” clause which would authorize Congress to “determine the proof and effect of such acts, records, and proceedings.” The Convention considered the amended provision on September 3 and, after some more tinkering with the language, passed the clause without significant disagreement.

The main reason for this difference is the same as the one accounting for the differences in the prohibitions of state powers: The Articles had tried to specify numerous exceptions, qualifications, and complications in their list of powers. Although the enumeration of powers in the Constitution takes up far less space, it includes far more powers. Some of these new powers were formidable—such as laying taxes, regulating commerce, raising armies, and making “all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers”—and some Antifederalists expressed horror at the extent of the new enumeration.

Such was the restrictions laid on congressmen from accepting other political offices. The specific provision in Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution had its origins in a similar provision in the Articles of Confederation, but the passionate debate over this issue went back much further: to the political controversies and imputed corruption that raged under the British Crown.   In Britain, the king had sole authority over the appointment power, and he could use it to bribe members of Parliament to vote according to his will by offering them tempting appointments in exchange—sometimes to offices of great prestige or profit that had been created only for that purpose. Although there were some who believed that this so-called “corruption” was in fact a necessary check between the branches and an unavoidable part of political wheeling and dealing, most Americans had been disgusted with this practice. Many state constitutions, as well as the Articles of Confederation, barred legislators from simultaneously serving in other offices.

This provision would prevent the possibility that offices would be created or made more lucrative only with the intention that a particular Congressman would fill them. In addition, following the example of the Articles of Confederation, the elective and appointed offices could not be held concurrently.

Members of Parliament needed to be able to discuss public measures—some of which might displease the Crown—freely and without fear of reprisals. It seemed far less important that ordinary citizens needed to enjoy this right.  \t Although many of America’s first state constitutions had included explicit provisions for the freedom of the press, most of the ones that had included any mention at all of a “freedom of speech” had extended that right only to legislators. The Articles of Confederation had likewise protected that right, and when the Committee of Detail drew up a draft constitution in the Convention, they inserted a provision that was modeled after the one in the Articles. They also followed the example of the Articles in protecting Congressmen from “civil arrests” (a physical detention to answer civil charges which is almost obsolete today).

They give reassurance to creditors (both foreign and domestic) that they will not be cheated out of what is owed to them just because there has been a regime change. And it is a message to the incoming government that they cannot use the new constitution as a pretext for shirking their obligations—they cannot say, “we were not the ones to incur the debt, so we should not be expected to pay it.” The Virginia Plan had likewise included a similar provision.   After variously trying out different formulas for this clause—should Congress merely be empowered to pay off the old debts or commanded to do so?—the final proposal came from Edmund Randolph: “All debts contracted, and engagements entered into, by or under the authority of Congress, shall be as valid against the United States, under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.” This wording received the approval of all the states except Pennsylvania. After some tinkering in the Committee of Style, the reassurance that the new Congress would abide by the obligations laid under the old one was inserted into Article VI of the Constitution.

The Articles had declared that: “Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in Congress assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.

They were able to convince enough of the nationalists that such a power was unnecessary and perhaps dangerous in the new Constitution, and in any case it would give too much alarm to the people. In the immediate wake of the nationalists’ defeat, Luther Martin (who was an inveterate supporter of states’ rights) threw his opponents a bone. He revived the notion of a supremacy clause, using wording very similar to what had been offered in the New Jersey Plan. This small concession was accepted unanimously and without debate. Its wording was changed slightly by the Committee of Style. The addition of this clause did not make the Constitution significantly different from the Articles of Confederation; the real difference lay elsewhere. Under the new Constitution, the government would actually possess the authority to enforce those powers in which it was supreme.
