The Framers would ultimately conclude that many of the powers over foreign affairs were not, properly speaking, executive in their nature, and they would vest them in the legislative branch or share them between the executive and the Senate. As a rule, however, all the domestic powers that were widely understood to be executive in nature would be lodged in that branch unless the Constitution said otherwise.

Most of the offices and departments that we normally associate with being “the government”—the military, the treasury, the post office, the IRS, etc.—are all constituent parts of the executive branch. Appointing officers to administer these departments has therefore traditionally been considered an executive function. When James Wilson was listing those powers that he considered to be “strictly executive” on June 1, he included only two: the execution of the laws, “and appointing officers, not appertaining to, and appointed by, the legislature.” Yet the heads of the most important departments can wield so much power, and can have such a profound influence on the direction of policy, that the Framers were reluctant to give the president a free hand with the most important appointment decisions. Additionally, whereas appointing executive officers may be considered a naturally executive function, it was far less obvious who should appoint judges.  \t The Virginia Plan had been silent on the question of appointments to executive offices, and it had provided that federal judges should “be chosen by the National legislature.” It is probable that Madison had presumed that the appointments of all executive officers would simply fall under the general heading of executive power. On June 1 he suggested they amend that clause to read that the national executive be explicitly empowered “to appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for.” This formula would place the presumption of the appointment power in the hands of the executive, but it would also allow the Framers to name certain exceptions to the general rule. This wording received almost unanimous support, and it was included in the report generated by the Committee of the Whole.

One of the main reasons for trusting the executive powers to just one person “was, that officers might be appointed by a single responsible person.” Rutledge objected that the appointment of judges was such a great power that it was improper to trust it to one person; the people were liable to suspect that they were creating a monarchy. Franklin pointed out that only two modes had been suggested so far, either by the legislature or the executive. “He wished such other modes to be suggested as might occur to other gentlemen; it being a point of great moment.” By June 13, the Framers had voted after only a little debate to vest the power to appoint federal judges in the Senate.

Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts suggested the style of appointment that was practiced by his own state: “that the judges be appointed by the executive, with the advice and consent of the second branch.” That process had been “found to answer perfectly well” in Massachusetts. Wilson preferred an appointment by the executive alone, but he favored Gorham’s suggestion if his own preference was impossible. The debates shifted to the possibility of vesting the power in the executive alone, but when it came to the point, only two states voted in favor of an executive appointment. Gorham then formally moved that they incorporate the Massachusetts model into the new Constitution, but that proposal lost on a tie vote. The delegates decided to postpone the question for the day.

Morris and Wilson repeated their disapproval with lodging the appointment power in the Senate, especially as it pertained to the appointment of judges. It was finally decided to refer this whole section to a committee. On September 4, the Committee on Postponed Matters proposed that: “The President … shall nominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, and other public ministers, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not otherwise herein provided for.” This provision was debated on September 7, and a few delegates rehearsed the well-worn arguments that this provision would give the president either too much or too little agency in the appointments. But most of the delegates were satisfied, for it passed overwhelmingly. For the most important appointments, including those to the federal judiciary, the Framers had decided to combine the responsibility that a single magistrate would bring to the choice with the security that an approval by the upper body of Congress would add.

Ordinarily, the executive is the one who is responsible for ensuring that transgressors of the law are punished for their misdeeds, but the executives in state constitutions (like the king of Great Britain before them) were often empowered, in individual cases, to do the opposite. Like so many of the executive powers named in the Constitution, this one was not considered until very late in the summer.  \t It was not until the Committee of Detail submitted its report on August 6 that the Convention was first confronted with a concrete proposal to vest the pardoning power in the executive. Their report suggested that the president “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons, but his pardon shall not be pleadable in bar of an impeachment.” On August 25, the Convention decided without debate to replace the last clause with the simpler: “except in cases of impeachment.” The president was therefore entrusted with a broad pardoning power, one which made an exception only for cases of impeachment. The Committee of Style had clarified that the president could only grant pardons “for Offences against the United States,” so the clause could never be construed to extend to infractions against state or civil law. That limitation, combined with the exception for impeachments, is the only restriction on the executive’s authority. Otherwise, the pardoning power gives to the president tremendous latitude for discretion.

The state constitutions had not embraced this power in the unconditional form enjoyed by Britain’s king, but many had adopted a veto in a partial or qualified form: one that could be overturned by a supermajority within the respective state legislatures. Wilson explained in the Convention that the veto power was granted to the executive branch “for collateral purposes” other than the mere execution of laws, including: 1) protecting the prerogatives of the executive branch; 2) preventing unwise or unjust legislation; and 3) preventing excessive legislation.

Any bill rejected by the council would have to be passed again by an unspecified proportion of legislators in each branch of Congress before it could become law. A similar form of the veto power was found in the New York Constitution, which formed a council of revision comprised of the chief executive and members of the judiciary.

But many other delegates were aghast at the thought of giving to one man the absolute power to obstruct the will of a popularly elected legislature.  \t Madison suggested that if they could fix on the right proportion required to override a veto, then “it would answer the same purpose as an absolute negative.” After all, the executive could never get away with obstructing a law that had the unanimous support of the legislature, no matter what the Constitution said. “The king of Great Britain,” said Madison, “with all his splendid attributes, would not be able to withstand the unanimous and eager wishes of both Houses of Parliament.” And besides, it was unlikely that the people would accept such an absolute power in their chief executive. Other members argued that they never would have voted for a single person to fill the executive office if they had known that it would be endowed with such stupendous powers. Dire predictions of an impending American monarchy were foretold, and all ten states rejected the proposal for an absolute negative. It was then agreed, 8-to-2, to allow Congress to overrule a veto if they could muster a two-thirds majority in each House.

On September 10, Randolph named the high bar for overturning the veto as among “his objections to the system.” On September 12, Hugh Williamson moved to reconsider the question. “He had, he remarked, himself proposed three fourths instead of two thirds; but he had since been convinced that the latter proportion was the best. The former puts too much in the power of the President.” Proponents for a stronger veto countered that this power had often proven ineffectual in the states when it could be overturned by a proportion that was too low. Madison pointed out that the threat of any executive abusing this power was not so great now as it had been when they first decided on three-fourths, since the election of the president had since become more popular and his term shorter than they had originally been contemplating.

In 1785, when Madison was contemplating the nature of the executive departments within the state constitutions, he concluded that these offices were not as important as they purported to be, since “all the great powers which are properly executive [were] transferd to the Fœderal Government.” What he meant by these “great powers” were those activities that Locke had called the federative powers: treaty-making, sending and receiving ambassadors, and the all-important power over war and peace. The Articles of Confederation had forbidden the states from exercising any of these powers; hence, what Madison had referred to as the “great powers which are properly executive” had, in point of fact, been taken out of the hands of any executive branch. They had instead been assigned exclusively to the Confederation Congress.  \t But in the Convention of 1787, the Framers were going to revisit the question of whether these powers were in fact “properly executive” in their nature. It was never contested among the delegates that international relations, including the powers over defense, treaties, and foreign commerce—what Sherman named as being the primary “objects of the Union”—would remain in the hands of the central government. Even the most committed defender of the states’ prerogatives knew that it would be dangerous to allow the states to exercise these powers independently. But since the new Constitution would be instituting a real government, one that would be separating powers into three different departments, the real question was: how should these powers be divided among the newly created branches of government?

But the president was to serve as commander-in-chief of the state militias only “when called into the actual Service of the United States.” The Framers knew that the powers, prestige, and importance of the executive are always inflated during wartime, and that tendency was one of the most compelling reasons for excluding the president from the initial decision to go to war.

He disliked giving the Senate this power because that body “represented the states alone.” He suggested instead that “it was proper that the President should be an agent in treaties.” However, instead of discussing further the possibility of involving the executive, the Convention went into a lengthy and fruitless consideration of whether treaties should be ratified by the whole Congress or just one branch.

Most of the Convention seemed satisfied to divide this power between the president and the Senate, and when this part of the clause came up for a vote it was unanimously approved. Once again, the Convention was united in their rejection of what had been common wisdom: that the management of international affairs belongs entirely within the executive department. \t The Convention considered separately the provision that a two-thirds majority in the Senate would be required to approve a treaty, and this part was more controversial. Wilson again objected and again on populist grounds. Requiring a supermajority “puts it into the power of a minority to control the will of a majority.” King agreed with Wilson, and he added that the supermajority was an especially unnecessary precaution since “the executive was here joined in the business” of treaty-making, and so the Constitution already provided a check that hadn’t existed under the Articles.

In this regard his powers were similar to those exercised by traditional monarchs. Yet in certain crucial respects he was restrained in his involvement with international matters. His choice for ambassadors would have to be confirmed by the “advice and consent” of the Senate, and his power to craft treaties was even further constrained by the necessary two-thirds assent in that branch. Perhaps most important, Congress was charged with making the most significant international decisions of all: whether the country is at war and how many resources to allocate to that war. The president is therefore the Constitution’s leading actor on the international stage, but he cannot perform effectively without the support of many players.

Although there were some delegates who had wanted to give the president more extensive powers, there were also numerous critics who complained that the Constitution gave him too much. Pierce Butler privately confided that he thought that the Framers had given the president too much power, and he blamed the Convention’s imprudent choices on the pervasive assumption that George Washington would be elected the first president. The delegates, he said, had “shaped their Ideas of the Powers to be given to a President, by their opinions of his Virtue.” Butler doubted that future presidents would be as incorruptible as General Washington, and he sadly predicted that the same “Man, who by his Patriotism and Virtue, Contributed largely to the Emancipation of his Country,” might one day be the unwitting cause of its downfall. Yet the potential for good or ill in the presidency is not exclusively determined by the degree of powers formally granted to that branch; rather, the degree of independence and accountability will more directly influence the likelihood that a president might abuse what powers he has. And the degree of independence and accountability would depend on some other crucial features that made a president distinct from a king: the mode of election, term length, re-eligibility, and the possibility of impeachment.without the support of many players.

Early sessions of the Senate lasted only three to six months, and Senators headed home to their respective states during the six-to-nine-month recesses, making them unable to provide their advice and consent to nominations during a large portion of the year.   To remain in effect, recess appointments must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the next session of Congress, or the position becomes vacant again. More than 300 judges have received recess appointments, including Supreme Court Justices William J. Brennan, Jr., Potter Stewart, and Earl Warren. The pace has slowed in recent years, however, and only a handful of federal judges have been appointed in recess since 1980.
