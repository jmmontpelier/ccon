The Articles were designed to place undisputed sovereignty in the state governments, and the population at large had learned from bitter experience to be very suspicious of faraway centralized power. Even among the men who actually wanted a strong national government, they were not very hopeful that a solution could be found anytime soon. Over the next three years, the circumstances in America underwent a dramatic transformation due to a little rebellion, a little overreaction, and a whole lot of political savvy and leadership exercised by men such as James Madison.

But Madison’s contributions were prominent at every stage of development: he led the charge to convene the Federal Convention in the first place; he arrived at Philadelphia with a plan that would guide all the Framers’ deliberations; he played a leading role in the debates both at the Federal Convention and at Virginia’s Ratifying Convention; and he wrote some of the most important essays (those remarkable Federalist papers) explaining and defending the new Constitution. Once the Constitution was adopted, he led the fight for amendments to guarantee individual rights and restrict the power of the federal government. Madison is even responsible for most of what we can know today about the Constitutional Convention, because he took the most comprehensive set of notes of the debates that summer. It is no wonder, then, that James Madison had been honored with the title “Father of the Constitution” by the time that document had reached its 40th birthday.

Just how much of a failure they were depends on your perspective: if one expected the Articles to function like a government, then its design was ill-conceived in the extreme. The meager powers it granted to the federal authority were often inadequate to meet the Confederacy’s needs—on that point many people were agreed—but the greater problem was that Congress could not enforce even the powers that it had. It could requisition money from the states, but it could not tax them directly. Therefore, if the states failed to pay their requisitions (and they often failed to pay), then the Confederation Congress was empowered only to say “please,” or, if circumstances were dire, it could even resort to “pretty-please.” The Articles had provided for no real executive power, no real judicial power, and its legislative power was lodged in a single body of Congress. The Congress allowed each state only one vote regardless of its size. Consequently, tiny Delaware had equal political weight with massive Virginia, even though Virginia had almost fifteen times the number of residents that Delaware had. In spite of its manifest flaws, amending the Articles was almost impossible, because that would have required the unanimous agreement of all thirteen states. Even garnering a simple majority of congressmen to agree on ordinary legislation was a challenging feat, since Congress was so generally disregarded that it often had difficulty mustering a quorum when it was in session. As a government, then, the Articles of Confederation were a contemptible failure.

The document declared at the outset that the compact was meant to establish “a firm league of friendship” between the states, and it unambiguously acknowledged that “each State retains its sovereignty.” It was intended, then, to be a sort of treaty or league, binding the 13 sovereign states in the same manner as NATO or the UN binds independent nations.   If viewed as an international alliance, the Articles were only a moderate failure. Unquestionably, they often failed to achieve even the limited aims the compact was designed to accomplish, but they did accomplish some important goals. The Articles were primarily intended to encourage friendly relations between the states, to ease trade negotiations with foreign nations, to pay off old war debts, and to present a credible show of united force against any potential foe. In all of these aims, the Confederation met with some success, albeit a very imperfect success. The Confederation Congress also passed the deservedly celebrated Northwest Ordinance during the same summer that the Constitutional Convention met.   Even the simple goal of keeping the states unified in their international policies and friendly toward each other was not as easy as many had expected. The individual states knew that history was brimming with cautionary tales of small republics that were continually at war with each other, and that is why the Articles of Confederation included various comity provisions. They were meant to prevent these quarrels from arising, or at least to find amicable ways of resolving them before they led to bloodshed or disunion. Under the Articles, states were forbidden from making exclusive treaties amongst themselves or private treaties with foreign nations. But the states were continually flouting the Articles’ prohibitions; they frequently sought to win lucrative commercial deals with neighboring states or with foreign countries.

As long as the world perceived the United States as thirteen small, independent republics, foreign powers could be expected to play a game of divide and conquer. It was in the interests of other countries to play one state or region against the others in order to procure the most advantageous trade deals for themselves. Any invading army would find these tiny bickering states ripe for the picking. Yet the mutual suspicions engendered by the weak Articles also made reforming the Articles all the more unlikely. If the Confederation Congress could not be trusted to act in the interests of every part of the union, then the last thing that people wanted was to give them more power. Respectable men were openly advocating a plan to divide the existing confederacy into multiple smaller ones.  Congress had not even been able to compel Great Britain to fulfill its obligations under the 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. The British continued to occupy forts in the western territories, menacing America’s frontier, and had freed slaves, all in violation of the treaty. Britain defended its actions by objecting (rightly) that the United States had likewise not complied with its own end of the bargain. The simple truth was that Congress was too weak to compel the states to pay the debts that it owed or to return confiscated property to the Loyalists. If these threats from foreign shores were to flare up into an international conflict, would the United States have the wherewithal to defend itself? Prospects did not look good at the beginning of 1786, and they had taken a turn for the worse by the end. A small domestic conflict in Massachusetts convinced men like Washington that, unless the faltering Articles were replaced with a stronger government adequate to meet their exigencies, the United States would not be able to remain free and independent for long.

The winners in any conflict, after all, get to write the histories, and the portrayal of the losing side often gets distorted. Nonetheless, in some ways, the misinformation about these events was even more significant than the facts, because it was the false reports and rumors that had the more important role in shaping the lead up to the Constitutional Convention.   The facts of the case, as we know them, are that a number of farmers, primarily in western Massachusetts, became desperate because of a combination of forces that threatened their livelihood. An economic depression contributed to their woes, and their financial circumstances were exacerbated by (as they saw it) unwise and unfair public policies, indifferent political elites, and a state constitution that favored wealthy merchants in the East over middle-class farmers in the West. Historians often characterize the rebels as debtors, but in reality they were suffering much more from a tight monetary policy and high taxes than excessive debt. By and large, these farmers owned much more than they owed. But a hefty amount of taxation, a small amount of debt, and an even smaller amount of ready money meant that large numbers of hardworking farmers were being hauled into debtors’ prison or losing their properties to foreclosure. The aggrieved farmers had tried first to seek redress through ordinary constitutional means. Only when their petitions and votes proved futile did they demand satisfaction by taking up arms.

Although his name would be immortalized, the uprising had no single leader; it was truly a decentralized movement. Many of the rebels’ demands were economic: they sought a lighter tax burden and the sort of debtor relief policies and paper tender laws that were beginning to gain favor within several states. Some states were alleviating the burden of debtors by issuing paper money that could be used to pay off debts, even though the new currency was not worth its face value (these paper tender laws were the sort of policies that struck terror into the hearts of creditors at the time). But the farmers were also demanding broader constitutional reforms. Eastern elites, they believed, held an unfair advantage because the state constitution gave them more representation in the Massachusetts legislature. If the western counties could be better represented in the state legislature, then laws would not be so heavily skewed against them. They wanted to lower the property requirements for suffrage, and they wanted to reapportion representation throughout the state so that it better reflected the actual distribution of the population—a population that was steadily drifting westward. These sorts of reform movements were common throughout the states in the early republic; the very same issues would precipitate Virginia’s Constitutional Convention in 1829. The difference in Massachusetts in 1786, however, was that the reformers finally resorted to violence to achieve their aims.

Onlookers came to see Shays’ Rebellion as proof that dangerous democratic excesses had come to their own shores. When James Madison later wrote in Federalist No. 10 about the urgent need to establish political protections against “a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project,” he demonstrated that and his peers had come to believe that horrors of mob rule were already making their appearance in America. And if swift action were not taken, then the United States would go the way of so many popular governments before them: they would be “as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_563","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_563","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_564","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_564","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_896","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_896","title":"Federalist No. 10 on ConText ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_846","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_846","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_848","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_848","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_608","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_608","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide52898","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Fear of the Rebels","thumbnail":"dr/Slide52898_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si52932","si52934","Image_795","Text_Caption_833","Text_Caption_834","Text_Caption_896","Image_846","Image_848"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide52898"}}},{"id":"si53019","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si53021","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_253","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_253","title":"Shays’ Rebellion and the Annapolis Convention ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_145","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_145","title":"From Mobocracy to Tyranny ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_835","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_835","title":"A Reactionary Craze Toward Monarchy?

They feared much more that such democratic turbulence would be followed by a reactionary craze toward monarchy. It may seem far-fetched to us today that newly independent American citizens might return to a monarchical government, but there were some sound reasons for the anxiety. During the darkest days of the Revolution, several officers of the Continental Army had begun plotting a coup to overthrow Congress and crown George Washington King of America. (Washington himself summarily quashed that idea.) Only a few years later, in the midst of the upheaval in Massachusetts, Prince Henry of Prussia actually received a letter begging him to accept the monarchy that was being offered to him in America. Some historians believe that the originator of that invitation was none other than Nathanial Gorham of Massachusetts. Gorham was President of the Confederation Congress at the time and a future delegate to the Constitutional Convention.   Americans were certainly not ready to welcome a king on their shores—arriving with crown, scepter, and ermine robes stuffed into his portmanteau—but it was true that several prominent men were openly advocating that Americans adopt a constitution that more closely resembled that of Great Britain. During the Constitutional Convention, Alexander Hamilton and a few other delegates urged their fellows to adopt a constitution with a “higher tone” than what they were contemplating—one that included a president with a lifetime appointment, and perhaps a senate that looked more like a House of Lords. Given a few more years of violence and political instability, Americans might have become more receptive to these suggestions.

When Governor Bowdoin tried to call forth the Massachusetts militia, the response was lackluster, to say the least. Some of the militia even joined forces with the rebels. When the state appealed to the Confederation Congress for help, the response was not much better. Only Virginia provided any funding for troops; other states simply ignored the request. If Americans wished to prove that republican government could survive in the modern world, then their performance on this, their first real test of the republican experiment after the Revolution, did not bode well that both good order and liberty could be maintained.   For those patriots who were passionately dedicated to republicanism, the apparent anarchy in Massachusetts was no less alarming than the slight inclinations toward monarchy they thought they perceived just around the corner. Several times during the crisis, leading men claimed that what was at stake in their endeavors was nothing less than the cause of popular government itself. If they could not find a solution to their problems, then America would go the way of many republics before it: a tumble into anarchy before seeking salvation in the waiting arms of tyranny. These fears may have lain under the surface even before Shays’ Rebellion, but the uprising in Massachusetts seemed a confirmation of the most pessimistic forecasts for American government. Rumors were rife that the ruling elite in Massachusetts were ready to give up on popular forms of government. Shortly after the Constitutional Convention opened for business, George Mason wrote to his son that he was relieved to find there “many men of fine republican principles.” After Shays’ Rebellion and its aftermath, he didn’t feel he could take that sentiment for granted.

The rebels were crushed and their leaders fled the state. Still, the rebels’ actions did finally attract serious attention to their grievances. In the election of 1787, Governor Bowdoin lost in a landslide, and the new administration made several concessions to the western farmers. Taxes were cut and most of the rebels received pardons. In short, the farmers in western Massachusetts were better off in the years following the uprising, and very little blood was spilled in the pursuit of their aims. \t The more important impact of the uprisings, however, extended beyond the borders of Massachusetts. Men who had previously opposed making any serious alterations to the Articles of Confederation were now leading the charge to call a general convention. Indeed, the governing elite in Massachusetts had been largely deaf to criticisms about the Confederacy before this crisis, but no more. Suddenly, a more powerful central government seemed more like an added security than a menace to the sovereignty of their state. And men in other states began to see the situation in the same light. Shays’ Rebellion might have been nothing more than a minor local skirmish—a footnote in our country’s history—if not for the effect it had on the success of the Constitutional Convention. It shook leading men out of their complacency and apathy and fueled the drive to amend the Articles. And for men like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton—who had been leading that drive all along—they took full advantage of the added impetus to push the states toward reform.

Their motivations for doing so were both economic and political. Not only did these improvements promise great commercial advantage for their backers, but providing easy access to the northwestern territories was imperative for keeping them out of the hands of the British.

Madison and Randolph did not even find out about the meeting until after it was over. In spite of these glitches, the planned meeting did have one ace in the hole: it had the backing of George Washington. Washington had been an ardent supporter of the scheme long before he had secured the backing of Virginia and Maryland, and he was then serving as The Potomac River Company’s first president. Washington had not been named as a delegate to this conference, but he nonetheless paid a visit to the participants meeting in nearby Alexandria. He invited the entire company to remove from the tavern where they were staying and enjoy the comforts of his own home.

Building upon the Mount Vernon Compact’s provisions that two or even three states might meet at future dates, albeit for the limited purpose of addressing issues arising from the Potomac, Madison instead engineered a proposal that a general convention be called—one to which all the states would be invited—for the purpose of addressing any and all commercial concerns. This idea was a small but significant step toward the call for a Constitutional Convention.  Originating from Madison’s proposal in the Virginia Assembly, all thirteen states were invited to meet at Mann’s Tavern in Annapolis, Maryland, on the first Monday in September 1786. But the circumstances leading up to this momentous event were not favorable to its success. Virginia was the only southern state to send delegates, and many New England states likewise gave the meeting the cold shoulder. The last thing these states wanted to do was give Congress greater control over commerce. Only five states met at the appointed time—an insufficient number to reach a quorum. Even Maryland failed to send any delegates, and they were hosting the event. But this passive boycott by all those who held the most parochial views effectually meant that the delegates who did show up—twelve in all—were uniformly members who held the strongest nationalist sentiment.

They proposed a Convention for the following year that would be given far greater scope than the Annapolis Convention had been given.   The proposal was drafted by Alexander Hamilton, who had for years been lobbying for radical changes in the Articles. The ever-cautious Edmund Randolph, however, balked at some of the fiery language Hamilton wanted to employ, and Madison convinced him to tone down the rhetoric. The resulting firm but dispassionate report recommended a convention “to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday in May next” for the purpose of “digesting a plan for supplying such defects as may be discovered to exist.” After citing the need to render “the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union,” it closed with a deferential appeal to authority, making clear that any proposed changes to the government that proceeded from this convention would be subject to the approval of Congress and “the Legislatures of every State.” The new convention might suggest some radical changes to the Articles, but the report promised that those changes would only be adopted following the amendment process described in the Articles. Their report was then sent to Congress and the Executives of each state.

They determined unilaterally that the next meeting was to be a wholesale constitutional convention. It was not that the idea was new; it was merely unpopular. Just a month before the Annapolis Convention met, Madison had estimated that there were probably be “many gentlemen” who would have preferred that the Convention have greater powers to reform the Articles. Although Madison himself would have readily endorsed the idea, he believed that the present temper of the country made it a lost cause. He therefore limited his ambitions for the Annapolis Convention to commercial reform, and, as he confessed to Jefferson, “I almost despair even of this.” Why then should the delegates suppose that they would have any better luck in less than a year’s time?   As it happened, the events within that single year altered the public mood considerably.  The timing of Shays’ Rebellion could not have been better calculated to rally support for the general convention if the rebels had taken up arms explicitly for that purpose. The Massachusetts ruling class, who had previously been very suspicious of centralizing power, moved to the head of the reform movement. Other states followed suit. The continental shift in sentiment was crucial for getting the Constitutional Convention off the ground.

It would take the acquiescence of state and federal governments to make it a plan. Once again, James Madison and the Virginia Assembly took the lead. This time, he was in for a pleasant surprise; his fellow assemblymen exhibited very little truculence compared to past battles over increasing federal power. Alarming news from Massachusetts had begun reaching Virginia, and the legislature unanimously endorsed the idea of a general convention before November was out. But Madison was setting his sights beyond his home state. Deploying Virginia’s greatest asset, he ensured that George Washington’s name be placed at the top of the list of delegates nominated to the Convention. He did this in spite of the General’s deliberate attempts to get out of the appointment. In a letter half-apologizing for this deviation from Washington’s clearly expressed preference, Madison wrote him: “it was the opinion of every judicious friend whom I consulted that your name could not be spared from the Deputation to the meeting in May, at Philadelphia.” He hinted that, if necessary, there would be time before the actual event for Washington to decline the nomination. But in the meantime, broadcasting his name was necessary for ginning up support for the Convention in the other states. To ensure that Virginia’s earnest and early endorsement of the upcoming Convention would have the maximum intended impact, the Assembly addressed their authorizing act both to Congress and to the executives of every other state.

The Framers themselves offered several reasons justifying why they departed from the narrower instructions of Congress. But it is worth asking in what way the congressional resolution bound the delegates in the first instance; or put another way: from whom did they receive their authority? Each state selected its own delegates, and each one wrote its own instructions for the commission. Only three states included the restrictive language adopted by Congress in their commissions, which means that a large majority of states attended without that restriction.   Individual states appended additional restrictions that were unique to the state’s peculiar concerns.

Similarly, Delaware bound its delegates to retain the equality of votes that the states had enjoyed under the Articles. If it is to be asked whether the Framers exceeded their authority when they scrapped the Articles altogether and started fresh, the stronger charge may be made against those delegates who violated the express mandates of their particular states. But although authority at that time flowed from state governments, not Congress, the state governments were not uniform in their instructions.

Although twelve of the thirteen states would send delegates for at least some portion of the Convention, there were never more than eleven represented at any one time. New Hampshire failed to provide its delegates with funding for travel expenses, so their delegates did not arrive until one of them reached into his own pockets to pay the way midway into the summer. By the time they arrived, two New York delegates had left in disgust over the direction the Convention was headed. The one holdout state was, of course, Rhode Island. Rhode Island was often the object of ridicule and invective for its domestic policies, and the state came under increased criticism for its failure to join the other states in Philadelphia. Before the Convention had completed its work that summer, however, the state’s General Assembly protested that they had never really been opposed to the notion of a convention at all. Be that as it may, Rhode Island’s habitual intransigence exasperated many of her sister states.  Amid the events leading up to Philadelphia, we see Madison playing an active leadership role that belies the image—which is sometimes inescapable among many of his biographers—that he was a reclusive scholar who rarely raised his head from his books. In the two years leading up to the Convention, he was the one who led the charge to convene the Annapolis Convention; he helped shape their report; he persuaded the Virginia Assembly to be the first to accept the invitation; and he goaded Congress to make that invitation official. In the next module, we will explore the Madison we are more familiar with: the bookish intellectual.

His treaty won seven northern votes and earned the animosity of all the southern states. If it had passed, it could have been devastating to the commercial interests of the southern and western regions. Without river access to the important ports, the interior country in the South would remain a backwater for generations to come, because transportation by any other means was too difficult to be commercially viable.

This action was of great significance in establishing civilian, rather than military rule, leading to a republic, rather than a dictatorship. Washington stands with two aides-de-camp addressing the president of the Congress, Thomas Mifflin, and others, such as Elbridge Gerry, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and James Madison. Mrs. Washington and her three grandchildren are shown watching from the gallery, although they were not in fact present at the event. However it is rumoured that the painting does portray Washington at different stages of his life. John Trumbull (1756–1843) was born in Connecticut, the son of the governor. After graduating from Harvard University, he served in the Continental Army under General Washington. He studied painting with Benjamin West in London and focused on history painting. This oil painting on canvas is now located in the United States Capitol rotunda in Washington D.C. Its dimensions are 365.76 cm × 548.64 cm (144.00 in × 216.00 in).
