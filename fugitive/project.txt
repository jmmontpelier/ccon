As early as 1774, the Continental Congress had passed a ban, of sorts, against the slave trade.  But the Continental Congress, like the Confederation Congress that followed, had no power to enforce the ban, so it was in reality no more than a statement of national goals, and it was widely ignored by the states.  Absent a central government to enforce these prohibitions, limitations on the slave trade would have to come from laws or constitutional provisions passed by the state governments.  And almost all of the states had voluntarily outlawed the international slave trade by 1787, but there was nothing preventing any state from reversing course if it so chose.  Even South Carolina had put a temporary prohibition on the importations prior to the Convention in 1787.  But this state had halted the trade for economic reasons, not for anti-slavery ones, and South Carolina’s delegates insisted that the federal government should not be allowed to control whether they decided to import slaves or not.  Leaving even one state free to import, however, would have continental significance.  As Mason pointed out in the Convention, the prohibitions of the other states “would be in vain, if South Carolina and Georgia be at liberty to import”; they would “fill” the western territory with slaves.

Paterson, Morris, King, Dickinson, and Luther Martin had all expressed concern that the three-fifths clause would lead to the unintended consequence of providing an encouragement for the further importation of slaves.    On July 23, the Convention decided to appoint a Committee of Detail, which would be assigned with the task of drawing up a draft constitution that summed up all their determinations to date.

The five-member Committee of Detail consisted of one delegate (Rutledge) who was stoutly pro-slavery, one member (Randolph) who was clearly opposed to the slave trade yet who had wanted to see other protections for the institution of slavery in the South, and three members (Gorham, Wilson, and Ellsworth) who were reliable Northern accommodators to Southern slave interests.  Still, the Committee’s report, which was read on August 6, only partially complied with Pinckney’s demands.  One section stipulated: “No tax or duty shall be laid by the Legislature on articles exported from any State; nor on the migration or importation of such persons as the several States shall think proper to admit; nor shall such migration or importation be prohibited.”  The first part of that section (forbidding the taxation of exports) was believed to benefit the economies of all of the Southern states (which were producers of export commodities such as tobacco and rice); the second part (relating to the “importation of such persons as the several States shall think proper to admit”) would prohibit the Congress from outlawing the slave trade or even taxing imported slaves.

The first salvo was launched by Luther Martin, who proposed reversing the gist of that section, “so as to allow a prohibition or tax on the importation of slaves.”  Martin was himself a slaveowner from Maryland, but like most of the delegates outside of South Carolina and Georgia, he had a deep antipathy to the slave trade, and he ticked off a number of reasons why it was high time to put an end to it.  In particular, if the Constitution were to allow the Deep South to continue importing slaves, it would be “inconsistent with the principles of the revolution, and dishonorable to the American character.”    John Rutledge of South Carolina, who was almost certainly the author of the slave-trade guarantee in the Committee’s report, would brook no opposition:  “Religion and humanity had nothing to do with this question.  Interest alone is the governing principle with nations.  The true question at present is, whether the Southern States shall or shall not be parties to the Union.”  Charles Pinckney reinforced the implied threat: “South Carolina can never receive the plan if it prohibits the slave trade.” And Abraham Baldwin later joined his state to the emerging phalanx: “Georgia was decided on this point.”  From the outset and repeatedly, South Carolina and Georgia stuck to their ultimatum: their “right” to import slaves would be protected by the Constitution or those two states would not be a party to the Constitution.  And by allowing these two states to remain outside of the Union, the delegates would not be changing any of their circumstances for the better: those states would still be able to continue importing slaves indefinitely. These two states soon discovered that they had allies from Connecticut.  Ellsworth and Sherman both gave lip service to the evils of the slave trade, but they also urged their colleagues not to make any difficulties over a power that it was not absolutely necessary for the new government to have.

He named various reasons why slavery should be suppressed as much as possible: “Slavery discourages arts and manufactures.  They produce the most pernicious effect on manners.  Every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant.” Mason even directed some of his polemic toward the New England shipping interests: he “lamented that some of our eastern brethren had, from a lust of gain, embarked in this nefarious traffic.”  He recognized that the Southern States had always possessed the power to decide this question for themselves before, but as “was the case with many other rights,” the right to import slaves must now “be properly given up.

The obduracy of Georgia and South Carolina on this question has been thoroughly examined by historians, but too few showcase the far more admirable stubbornness of the delegates who stood up to them.  Rufus King issued an ultimatum of his own: “If two states will not agree to the Constitution, as stated on one side, he could affirm with equal belief, on the other, that great and equal opposition would be experienced from the other states.”  John Dickinson “considered it as inadmissible, on every principle of honor and safety, that the importation of slaves should be authorized to the states by the Constitution.”  John Langdon of New Hampshire “was strenuous for giving the power to the general government.  He could not, with a good conscience, leave it with the states.”  Edmund Randolph declared that “he could never agree to the clause as it stands.  He would sooner risk the Constitution.”  Once the threats, nonnegotiables, and ultimatums had been liberally invoked on both sides, the delegates found that they had blustered themselves into an old-fashioned political standoff.

He suggested that they send the whole subject of the slave trade into a committee, “including the clauses relating to taxes on exports and to a navigation act.  These things may form a bargain among the Northern and Southern States.”  These seemingly irrelevant issues—taxes on exports and a power over Navigation Acts—were favorite objects of the Northern States, and up to this point in the Convention they had been unable to win the assent of the Convention as a whole.  The Northern States had been interested in laying taxes on exports for the purpose or raising national revenue, because they believed that such a tax would fall disproportionately on the Southern States.  And the New England states that were heavily involved in shipping had also wanted Congress to be able to pass “navigation acts”—which could be used to impose tariffs or close off some markets altogether—in order to protect domestic manufactures or retaliate against the commercial policies of other countries.

Consequently, the power to pass “navigation acts” had been excepted from the general power to regulate commerce.  Congress could still pass them, but they would require a two-thirds majority in each house.  This super-majority requirement would give the Southern States an effective veto over any commercial regulations unfavorable to that region.  Northern States, on the other hand, were concerned that effective trade regulation would be impossible without an easier way to pass navigation acts.  Morris was now suggesting that the two states from the Deep South could strike a bargain with some of the states from the North. A Committee was duly formed which included one member from each state; taken as a group they represented very diverse interests.  The report that emerged from the committee on August 24 had scaled back the ambitions from both sides: export taxes would still be forbidden; navigation acts would no longer be excepted from the simple majority rule; and Congress would not be able to interfere with the slave trade until the year 1800 (although they could lay an import duty “at a rate not exceeding the average of the duties laid on imports”).

So long a term will be more dishonorable to the American character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution.”  Since General Pinckney and James Madison had both been on the committee that drafted this compromise, it is very likely that this exchange was a reprise of an earlier battle that had already been fought in committee, with the South Carolinian evidently believing that he had been on the losing side.  However, if it was true that he had already lost in committee, Pinckney’s appeal was now directed to an assemblage that was more disposed to appease him.  Madison’s objection was the only one voiced, and the extension passed, 7-to-4.  There is a palpable sense in the exchanges from this day forward that the delegates were now eager to contain and resolve this late-blooming explosion as quickly and tidily as possible; they had no wish to allow a few hot tempers to overthrow an entire summer’s labors, even over such a difficult and volatile issue as slavery.

The delegates then proceeded to debate the related clause about placing duties on the imported slaves.  Interestingly, those who were unified in their opposition to the slave trade were divided on this question.  Sherman and Madison did not want any duties attached to the importations, because it had the effect of “acknowledging men to be property,” and they “thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men.”  Others, however, argued that exempting slave importers from paying any duties at all would be the practical equivalent of granting them a bounty on their trade, because they would be the only traders who were exempt from paying taxes.  For those who were opposed to the slave trade, the choice lay between a distasteful logical implication or an offensive practical result.  The delegates from the Deep South only wanted to be assured that Congress could not levy such a high duty that it would be tantamount to a prohibition on the imports.

The final touch was added on September 10, when South Carolina insisted that the twenty-year compromise must be safe from the amendment process.

The states voted, 9-to-1, to safeguard that provision from the threat of amendment.

Even before the deal had been finalized, the delegates from South Carolina had announced their intentions in this regard.  During a consideration of the clause guaranteeing the rendition of fugitives from justice, Charles Pinckney and Pierce Butler “moved to require ‘fugitive slaves and servants to be delivered up like criminals.’”  The immediate response from the states northward was that no state should be required to pay for the capture and return of other states’ slaves and servants.  Butler’s proposal made clear that escaped slaves and servants, if they should flee to other states, would “not be discharged from such service or labor” by the laws subsisting in any other state; instead, the escapee would “be delivered up to the person justly claiming their service or labor.”  No one opposed Butler’s motion and it passed with unanimous consent.   \t There was so little debate preceding the passage of the fugitive slave clause that it is impossible to infer with any certainty what was on the Framers’ minds when they voted to adopt it.  At the time, the comity which then existed between the states meant that most slaves were already returned to their masters without incident, though the Southern States had a perpetual fear that Northern States might one day assert their common law right to free slaves that sought refuge within their borders.  It was also the case that most states, whether North or South, did not relish the prospect of welcoming a large population of free African Americans into their midst (regardless of how they had become free).

In the first place, its passive voice makes it unclear if the states were responsible for anything more than non-interference in the recapture of fugitive slaves.  In the second place, the Framers were very careful to word the clause so that the recognition of the property in slaves (much less the legitimacy of such a property) would not be explicitly recognized in the constitutional text. Butler’s original proposition had required that slaves must be returned to the persons who were “justly claiming their service or labor.” In the Committee of Style, any reference to the “just” claims of the slaveowner was dropped, and the clause was referred instead to the slave or servant who was “legally held to service or labour.” Finally, just two days before the Convention was adjourned, “the term ‘legally’ was struck out; and the  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1188","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1188","title":"words ‘under the laws thereof,’ inserted … in compliance with the wish of some who thought the term legal equivocal, and favoring the idea that slavery was legal in a moral view.”  This change of wording cleared up two potential ambiguities (though it left behind others).  It was now clear that the Constitution did not recognize the moral “lawfulness” of slavery, and it was clear that it was not under the Constitution that men were recognized as property; rather, it was under the laws of the states that men were held to service or labor.  The distinction may be rather subtle or abstruse, but at least some of the Framers had considered it imperative that the Constitution give no explicit sanction to the institution of slavery. Still, the fugitive slave clause is arguably the most shameful clause in the Constitution, because in practice it would unavoidably implicate the new federal government in the protection of slave property.  When put in practice, starting with federal legislation in 1793, it would also be a moral, political, and legal nightmare for the young republic.

And the federal government would now be empowered to outlaw the slave trade throughout the United States in twenty years, a power that they had never had before.  Even the 20-year allowance of the slave trade was granted only to “the states now existing,” which meant that the new Congress could forbid the slave trade into any territories or any states that were created before 1808.  Congress did in fact act on every power they were granted: they prohibited the international slave trade into the Mississippi Territory in 1798 and into the Louisiana Territory in 1804, and they outlawed the trade throughout the country at the earliest possible moment, going into effect on January 1, 1808.

Therefore, for those opponents who witnessed its formation—such as George Mason and Luther Martin—the most noxious part of the compromise was the quid pro quo demanded by the New England states.  But this venal aspect of the bargain should not be allowed to totally obscure what was admirable in the debates.  There were a few delegates who stood up to the intransigent members from South Carolina and Georgia and insisted that the international slave trade must finally come to an end.  As General Pinckney acknowledged in the South Carolina legislature, the Deep South had been forced to yield on this question because of “the religious and political prejudices” of some of the other members.  It is to the credit of men such as Mason, King, Dickinson, Langdon, and Randolph that the Constitution held out any promise that there would be an end to the further imports of slaves.
