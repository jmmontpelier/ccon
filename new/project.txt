As early as 1785 he had called Virginia’s executive office “the worst part of a bad Constitution.” He thought the organization of this branch was “vague & perplexed,” and its members were too numerous and far too dependent on Virginia’s legislature. The result was an executive office that was powerless—a mere creature of the legislative branch.   Virginia’s constitution was typical of the way that other states had chosen to separate powers at this time. Madison complained in the Convention that “the executives of the states are in general little more than ciphers; the legislatures omnipotent.” And unless the Framers could find a solution to this threat of legislative tyranny, Madison believed that the fate of republican ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1134","title":"government itself was in doubt. Yet Madison was by no means confident that he knew how to remedy these defects. Just one month before the Convention was due to meet, he acknowledged to George Washington: “I have scarcely ventured, as yet, to form my own opinion either of the manner in which [the executive] ought to be constituted, or of the authorities with which it ought to be cloathed.” His fellow Virginians may have been equally uncertain, because the Virginia Plan contained only the barest outlines prescribing what that office should look like.  The question of the executive was one of the last resolved by the Convention. With less than two weeks to go before the Convention completed their work, Madison confided to Thomas Jefferson that, among the important features of the Constitution, “the mode of constituting the Executive is among the few points not yet finally settled.” The Convention struggled “to unite a proper energy in the Executive … with the essential characters of Republican Government.” In essence, they wanted an executive that would be energetic enough to perform its most crucial functions effectively—which meant having enough power and independence to defend the country from internal and external foes and to check the legislature when needed—yet they wanted the executive to be thoroughly republican and restrained from growing too powerful.

Immediately after the Revolution, a very pro-democratic and anti-monarchical fervor had swept through the former colonies. Americans were prone to view executive power as the equivalent of monarchy and monarchy as the equivalent of tyranny. After bouncing the royal governors, the newly independent states were loath to replace them with an office of similar power and prestige. Consequently, state constitutions typically provided for very weak executives. The legislature was seen as the repository of the people’s will, and it was therefore the legislature that received the public trust (and most of the political power). The executive branch was frequently made very dependent on the legislature, usually for its election and sometimes even for its salary. Even more frequently, the state executives were dependent on a privy council in order to exercise some or all of their functions. The president of Pennsylvania was arranged very much like the president of Congress under the Articles of Confederation: he merely “presided” over an executive council, but he had very few powers that he could exercise independently. The federal exercise of executive powers was certainly no improvement. Under the Articles of Confederation, very few powers that were strictly executive had been granted to the confederacy at all (most federal laws were supposed to be executed by state governments). And when certain powers, such as foreign policy, were executed centrally, there was no real separation of powers: Congress either executed the powers themselves or delegated them ad hoc to individual bodies under their control. The Articles had simply not provided for a separate and independent executive branch.

George Washington, the president of the Convention, knew better than anyone the dangers of a diffuse and ineffective executive branch during a time of crisis. Nevertheless, most of them were no less committed to resisting anything that resembled a traditional monarchy. Their available choices, then, lay between these two well-traveled paths. They wanted to secure many of the advantages of monarchical rule without suffering its hazards.   They chose to innovate, and their final product is testimony of their creativity. They decided to trust the executive powers to a single magistrate, and they devised a mode of election that would make him as independent of his electors (and Congress) as possible. They granted him a tenure that was considered lengthy for the time, but not too lengthy for a proper republic, and they allowed him to be eligible for more than one term. And perhaps most important, they carefully distributed what had traditionally been considered powers belonging to the executive branch. Powers that were unquestionably executive were given to the president with or without qualification. But powers relating to foreign affairs were divided up. Some were given to the president with or without qualification; some were granted to Congress; and some were shared between the Presidency and the Senate. This novel mixture would create an executive branch like no other. The president was meant to be a powerful and energetic executive, yet he was also meant to be thoroughly republican and restrained by the constitutional order.

When the Committee of the Whole began to debate this resolution on June 1, James Wilson quickly proposed “that the executive consist of a single person,” and Charles Pinckney readily seconded the proposal. What happened next was what Madison described as “a considerable pause.” One can easily imagine the awful silence that fell on the room as the delegates weighed whether it would be acceptable to construct an executive office for the federal government—one that could very likely wield immense power—and then trust that office to a single person. Finally, the chairman of the committee broke the silence by asking if they should put the proposal to a vote.

Here, Rutledge put his finger on the nub of their difficulties. In Europe, monarchs were traditionally empowered with all manner of international relations, including, and most importantly, the final determination and command over war and peace. Enlightenment thinkers such as Locke, Blackstone, and Montesquieu had taught that these powers were most sensibly lodged within the executive branch. But as their discussions would reveal, most of the Framers seemed inclined to depart from the European example.

Wilson agreed that a single executive had the advantage of greater responsibility, and he added that it would also give greater energy and dispatch when those qualities were needed. For Rutledge and Wilson, their preference for a single executive magistrate was based on the qualities they believed were necessary for the effective exercise of that office.  \t Wilson’s ideal executive magistrate would have been “a single responsible person” who was unfettered by, and independent of, either the legislature or an executive council. Consequently, he advocated that the president be popularly elected (and certainly not elected by the legislature). Wilson’s notions of a vigorous executive also required that such a person be able to wield an absolute veto over the legislative acts of Congress; only then could he defend the office’s prerogatives against the encroaching tendencies of the popular branch. In a monarchy, it was the king that was most to be feared; but in a republic, legislative tyranny was the greatest threat, and the other powers needed defensive mechanisms to enable them to protect themselves from that overweening branch. Finally, Wilson’s executive would be exclusively tasked with fulfilling some of the most important discretionary powers assigned to the executive office, such as appointing judges and ambassadors and pardoning criminals (although he did not think that the executive’s discretion should extend to all matters of international affairs). Wilson believed that an executive must be able to exercise considerable discretion and provide a strong check against the legislature.

He said that “he considered the executive magistracy as nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the legislature into effect.” Far from requiring personal responsibility, such a person (or persons) should be responsible to “the legislature only, which was the depository of the supreme will of the society.” According to Sherman, an executive, properly speaking, has no will of its own; this branch of government exists only to carry out, or execute, the will of others. Consequently, the executive should be utterly dependent on the body it was meant to serve. Sherman’s ideal executive looked very different from Wilson’s. Its members would not be fixed in number; the executive should be both appointed by and removable by the legislature; and the discretionary powers ordinarily attached to this branch—such as treaty-making, judicial appointments, and the veto power—should be minimal, qualified, or nonexistent. This executive (or executives) would be the mere creature of the legislature.  \t It should go without saying that the Framers had by no means abandoned their antipathies toward monarchy. Making the executive independent of the legislature was, in Sherman’s opinion, “the very essence of tyranny, if there was any such thing.” And Edmund Randolph “strenuously opposed” lodging the powers of the executive in a single person: “He regarded it as the foetus of monarchy.” He acknowledged that the qualities of “vigor, despatch, and responsibility” were often requisites for this office, but he could not see why they might not be found as well in a body of “three men, as well as in one man.”   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_729","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_729","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_730","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_730","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1164","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1164","title":"Federalist No. 70 on ConText ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1000","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1000","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1001","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1001","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_743","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_743","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide68071","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Carrying out the Will of the Legislature","thumbnail":"dr/Slide68071_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si68105","si68107","Text_Caption_1146","Text_Caption_1164","Image_1000","Image_1001"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide68071"}}},{"id":"si70635","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si70637","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_361","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_361","title":"A New Executive ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_232","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_232","title":"Debate in the Convention: Form or Function First?

In the end, neither man got exactly the executive he had wanted, but the Convention leaned farther in the direction of Wilson’s energetic and independent executive than Sherman’s subservient one. On the first day of considering the executive office, the Committee “by common consent” merely postponed the question of the number suitable to occupy it. Madison observed that “it would be proper, before a choice should be made between a unity and a plurality in the executive, to fix the extent of the executive authority.” In other words, the real crux of the matter was determining which powers were properly executive. Once they could determine the proper extent of this office, it would be easier to determine how many people ought to exercise it. But this decision to postpone the question threatened to lead them into a catch-22 situation, because they were at times unwilling to decide on the extent of executive powers before knowing how many persons would exercise that power, and they were unwilling to fix a number in the executive without knowing what powers would be wielded.

The question was again postponed, only to be taken up again on June 4. Again it was proposed that the executive be exercised by one person. Wilson contended that Randolph’s objections to a unity in the executive were exclusively focused on a supposed unpopularity for the measure, one which he did not believe existed. All of the state constitutions had a single person at its head. “All know that a single magistrate is not a King.” A triumvirate executive, as Randolph had proposed, would be liable to all manner of infighting and disruptions within the government and could tear the country apart. For Wilson, the lessons of history taught the absolute necessity of a unitary executive and the very real dangers that anything else posed. Without unity and clear responsibility, the government would be either adrift or torn apart by competing executives.  \t Roger Sherman pointed out that all the state executives were bound by “a council of advice.” He thought such a council would be necessary to make a single federal executive acceptable to the people. The addition of such a council, said Wilson, was liable to many of the same objections as having a plural executive. Elbridge Gerry believed that multiple executives were especially dangerous “in military matters,” where the group would constitute “a general with three heads.”   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_733","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_733","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_734","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_734","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1167","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1167","title":"Situation Room ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1003","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1003","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1005","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1005","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1170","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1170","title":"First Cabinet of President Obama ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1008","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1008","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1010","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1010","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_745","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_745","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_747","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_747","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide68238","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Debate in the Convention","thumbnail":"dr/Slide68238_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si68272","si68274","Text_Caption_1150","Text_Caption_1167","Image_1003","Image_1005","Text_Caption_1170","Image_1008","Image_1010"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide68238"}}},{"id":"si68405","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si68407","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1041","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1041","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_364","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_364","title":"A New Executive ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_982","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_982","roles":{}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_235","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_235","title":"The Convention Chooses a Single Executive ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1154","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1154","title":"When put to a vote, the Committee decided, 7-to-3, to accept a single executive (New York, Delaware, and Maryland voting no). This determination went largely unchallenged for the rest of the summer. The rival New Jersey Plan had attempted to reopen this question, and Wilson denounced the Plan because it did not definitively prescribe “a single magistrate.” When the question came up before the Convention as a whole on July 17, the clause providing for a single person to fill the role of chief executive passed without any dissent. Later, the Framers would decide to equip the president with a sort of council (the collection of secretaries, each one of which the Constitution refers to as, “the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments”). And the Constitution authorizes the president to require their opinions “in writing,” but he is not required to heed their opinions. Nonetheless, even when the Convention made their final decision to accept a single chief magistrate in mid-July, the powers attached to the executive branch were still largely an open question.
