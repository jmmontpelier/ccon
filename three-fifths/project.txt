After all, taxation was always based on distinctions in wealth; therefore, it was fitting that political power—which was to determine the taxes which would be levied on the states—should also be, at least in part, based on distinctions of wealth. This consideration was even more compelling because Congress was not designed merely to represent individual citizens; it was also designed to represent state interests as such. Even those members who were at some moments the loudest in proclaiming the justice of proportional representation—such as James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, James Wilson, and Rufus King—were willing at other moments to concede that the number of free inhabitants was not the only consideration worthy of factoring into the equation for representation. And the most important secondary consideration was the differences in wealth. \t In fact, there did not seem to be a single delegate who consistently argued that representation should be based on free population alone.  The various proposals for representation that were offered in the Convention would have factored into the equation either the states, the money paid into the federal treasury, property in general, or slaves in particular.  The main difficulty with the three-fifths clause (for those who perceived any difficulty at all) was the appearance of inflating the political power of slaveowners by counting (even partially) the numbers of those whom they oppressed. Many of these objections would probably have been removed if the Constitution had arrived at the same apportionment in the balance of representation between the Northern and Southern States but had found a different means for achieving the same effect.  Many others would have been satisfied if other forms of property were included rather than singling out slaves alone.

A few years earlier, Congress had proposed changing the way that money was requisitioned from the states. Instead of basing requisitions on the value of real estate (which was what the Articles of Confederation had prescribed but which was increasingly seen as unworkable), Congress proposed basing requisitions on the whole number of free population and counting slaves as three-fifths (in fact, it was Madison who had proposed that precise number).

Why, then, should the blacks, who were property in the south, be, in the rule of representation, more than the cattle and horses of the north?” At first glance, Gerry’s analogy appears deeply offensive, because it appears as though he is merely comparing African-Americans to cattle and horses. Yet it is unlikely that he meant anything demeaning to African-Americans.  In spite of the crudeness of Gerry’s articulation, his larger point is an important and valid one. No other property was being counted in order to swell the political power of any state. Why was a property in slaves being singled out, as if it were a privileged form of wealth, in order to augment the political clout of the Southern States? Gerry was trying to articulate a repulsive feature that was lying below the surface of the three-fifths clause. The other delegates had not yet grappled with the implications of Gerry’s dissent, but that same objection would gain force and increase the delegates’ discomfort with the three-fifths clause as the summer progressed and its meaning struck home.

This proposal also passed, though by a much narrower margin (6-to-5). It is clear from the votes that those who objected to the new rule were opposed to proportional representation of any kind in the second chamber; they were not dissenting because they objected to the three-fifths clause as such.  \t The delegates moved on to other matters, and the subject of the three-fifths clause did not come before the Convention again until almost a month later. When it did reemerge it immediately became embroiled in the more contentious question of whether the states should be represented proportionally or equally in the two houses.

Madison was the first to articulate the suggestion that the small-state/large-state distinction was mostly imaginary: “the states were divided into different interests, not by their difference of size, but by other circumstances; the most material of which resulted partly from climate, but principally from the effects of their having, or not having, slaves.” These circumstances resulted in markedly different economies in the two regions, and each economy was built upon a complex of distinct interests. Since “the great division of interests in the United States” lay between the Northern and Southern States, continued Madison, each region should be given sufficient political power to protect itself from the other.

Increasing the political leverage of Southern States in Congress was one way of providing a measure of security from federal encroachment. Carolina had difficulty convincing even many of their fellow Southerners that counting slaves fully was an equitable resolution; Georgia was the only other state to fully embrace this solution.

He said he was “reduced to the dilemma of doing injustice to the Southern States, or to human nature, and he must therefore do it to the former; for he could never agree to give such encouragement to the slave trade as would be given by allowing them a representation for their negroes.”  \t Rufus King was at first an early supporter of the three-fifths clause, acknowledging that any equitable ratio of representation would have to account for the “superior wealth” of the Southern States. After listening to some of Morris’ arguments, however, he began to waver in his support, though for a while he was still willing to vote for the three-fifths clause “for the sake of doing something.” As the debates wore on, however, he became increasingly disinclined to accept it. More than 30 years later, King (then a senator) would come to believe that the Northern States had perhaps conceded too much when they agreed to the three-fifths clause: “The concession was, at the time, believed to be a great one, and has proved to have been the greatest which was made to secure the adoption of the constitution.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_729","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_729","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_730","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_730","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1161","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1161","title":"Gouverneur Morris ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_984","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_984","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_987","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_987","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1173","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1173","title":"Rufus King ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1007","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1007","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1011","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1011","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_740","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_740","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_748","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_748","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide68056","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Northern Misgivings","thumbnail":"dr/Slide68056_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si68090","si68092","Text_Caption_1147","Text_Caption_1148","Text_Caption_1161","Image_984","Image_987","Text_Caption_1173","Image_1007","Image_1011"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide68056"}}},{"id":"si68170","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si68172","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_361","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_361","title":"The Three-Fifths Compromise ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_232","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_232","title":"A Contentious Resolution ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1150","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1150","title":"On July 12, Gouverneur Morris suggested adding to the clause relating to the rule of representation “a proviso, ‘that taxation shall be in proportion to representation.’” Three Southerners in quick succession admitted the justice of Morris’ attempt to tie representation to taxation, and the South Carolinians immediately tried again to count slaves as equal to freemen.  \t From all of these debates, it is clear that the bone of contention among the delegates was confined to the question of including slaves in the rule of representation. The corresponding inclusion of slaves into the rule of taxation was never contentious. Unlike with representation, no one perceived a theoretical problem with the inclusion of slaves into a rule that sought merely to estimate a state’s wealth. Also, all of the Southern States had already agreed to adopt the three-fifths ratio for taxation under the Articles of Confederation; New York and New Hampshire were the only holdouts keeping the states from adopting this amendment.  The relative indifference to applying the rule to taxation was also because no one expected the federal government to raise much money through direct taxation. For most of the Framers, tying the two issues of representation and taxation together was meant only for the sake of appearances. The primary purpose of the three-fifths clause, then, was to find a rule for representation that both the North and the South could accept; the same ratio was later tied to taxation only to give the (false) appearance that its primary purpose was not related to representation.

The three-fifths clause—along with its theoretical baggage: that the Southern slaveowner’s representation was enhanced on the basis of his slaves—was therefore engrafted into the Constitution. And the original sin was later exacerbated, when it was decided to tie the number of presidential electors to each state’s allocation of Representatives and Senators (which would indirectly make the three-fifths rule apply to presidential elections as well as congressional ones). Although the Framers had attempted to tart up the appearance of the three-fifths clause by tying the same ratio to taxation, the real issue has always been about finding an equitable rule for representation, and this compromise has long been considered among the most embarrassing features of our founding document.

That standard of apportionment, however, was far from being the only perspective among those who were debating in 1787 and 1788, and this is true regardless of the region that was doing the debating. Most delegates had seemed satisfied that the balance of power between the two regions was about right; that is, that the compromise accurately reflected the relative political importance of each side.  When the three-fifths ratio was first proposed, only two states had objected to it, and only because they did not want any form of proportional representation whatsoever.  The objections only came later, when the implications of the clause (rather than the division of power) were made clear.  Those delegates who objected to the three-fifths clause—both in the Constitutional Convention and in the ratifying conventions—based their arguments on the explicit use of slaves to augment Southern political influence; they did not argue that the Southern States had too much influence overall. Jefferson’s detractors called him the “Negro President,” because without the extra Electoral College votes awarded to states with large slave populations, he would not have won his election against John Adams.  And during the crisis over the Missouri Compromise, Northerners, including Rufus King, who was then a senator, tried to prevent the three-fifths rule for apportionment from being applied to new slave states in the West.

Charles Pinckney, who had fought unsuccessfully to have slaves counted fully for representation, resented later attempts by Northern delegates to mitigate the effects of the three-fifths clause by excluding its application to the new states. In a speech before the House of Representatives, he argued in 1821 that the Northern States ought “to be highly pleased with their present situation; that they are fully represented, while we have lost so great a share of our representation; they ought, sir, to be highly pleased at the dexterity and management of their members in the Convention, who obtained for them this great advantage.” Each side would argue that the other side  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1157","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1157","title":"had gotten more than its fair share of representation, which is typically a sure sign that a real compromise has taken place between the two sides.  But the passage of the three-fifths clause also aggravated another problem that had already been an irritant in the Convention. Various members from several other states had wanted to outlaw the African slave trade for good. Now that the Southern States would be represented on the basis of the number of their slaves, the situation resulted in a perverse incentive for the South to add to the ranks of their enslaved inhabitants. Rufus King “never could agree to let [slaves] be imported without limitation, and then be represented in the national legislature. Indeed, he could so little persuade himself of the rectitude of such a practice, that he was not sure he could assent to it under any circumstances.” However, if the three-fifths clause would add to the South’s incentives to import more slaves, it would also increase the motivation that was already latent in many of the other delegates to put an end to the evil of the slave trade once and for all.
