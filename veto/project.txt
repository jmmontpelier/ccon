But probably one of the most audacious features in it was the “federal veto” over state legislation. And if Madison had stuck to his original idea, the proposal would have been even more audacious than what was presented to the other delegates. Writing to Edmund Randolph more than a month before the Convention was due to open, he unfolded his designs: “Let [the national government] have a negative in all cases whatsoever on the Legislative Acts of the States.” Those fatal words, “in all cases whatsoever,” would have been immediately recognizable to the recently independent American states. As Madison went on to explain, it was the same power that the king of Great Britain had previously exercised over the colonies. This power, he believed, would be the “middle ground” between state sovereignty and a consolidated republic. He believed it was both “essential and the least possible abridgement of the State Sovereignties.” Over the course of the Convention, most of the other Framers came to believe that less abridgement of state sovereignty was not only possible, but far more desirable.  \t In order to understand why this feature seemed so crucial to Madison, it is necessary to understand both how he diagnosed the problems of the Confederacy and how he envisioned their solution. In his “Vices of the Political System of the United States,” Madison outlined two broad problems with legislation being passed by the states. First, state laws encroached on the federal authority and violated the rights of the other states. Second, they often resulted in oppressive or inequitable policy within the states themselves. Madison believed that the best remedy would be to allow a general legislature to have the final say on all laws, rather than allow state lawgivers to exercise that supreme power.

It was at this point that Madison employed what would become his most famous argument, the one that he later used in Federalist No. 10. A legislative body that represented a large territory and a more numerous population would naturally encompass a greater number and variety of local interests. These numerous and competing interests would prevent any one of the merely local and self-interested aims from attaining a majority. Individual members of a large representative body would not necessarily act with greater wisdom or justice than the members of a smaller body, but their collective deliberations would more likely avoid the worst consequences of a small provincial legislature.

Instead of a veto “in all cases whatsoever,” the Virginia Plan would have authorized the national legislature “to negative all laws passed by the several states contravening, in the opinion of the national legislature, the Articles of Union.” In other words, this power would only authorize Congress to veto state legislation whenever Congress determined that it encroached on federal authority, not in cases when Congress concluded that such laws were unjust to a state’s own citizens or the citizens of other states.

Benjamin Franklin suggested that, in addition to vetoing laws that encroached on legitimate federal powers, state laws also needed to be vetoed if they contravened “any treaty subsisting under the authority of the Union.” Madison then reports that this momentous clause was “agreed to without debate or dissent.” Madison must have been elated. And he probably then regretted that the Virginia Plan had been so restrained in its aims. Soon enough, he began to argue that Congress should be given even more expansive latitude to exercise the federal veto.  \t\t On June 8, Charles Pinckney moved “that the national legislature should have authority to negative all laws which they should judge to be improper.” He defended this expansion of the federal veto because the federal government needed to protect itself from the encroaching powers of state legislatures. Then he added, “this universal negative was in fact the corner-stone of an efficient national government.” Madison seconded this motion, and expanded on the reasons for it. Not only was the “indefinite power to negative legislative acts of the states” necessary to protect national prerogatives and the integrity of treaties, but it was also necessary to guard against the tendency of state governments “to infringe the rights and interests of each other; [and] to oppress the weaker party within their respective jurisdictions.” A universal veto was “the mildest expedient” they could adopt to prevent these internal abuses committed by the states.

And even John Dickinson, who was generally a stout defender of states’ rights, “deemed it impossible to draw a line between the cases proper, and improper, for the exercise of the negative,” and therefore he thought the broader power was necessary. But his colleague from Delaware, Gunning Bedford, thought that the small states would be especially harmed by this power. He also questioned the practicality of such a veto power: Would the states have to wait for the Congress to approve each state law before it went into force? How long would it take Congress to review all the legislation from all 13 states? Pierce Butler said it was not the small states that had the most to fear from the power; rather, it was the most distant states—like South Carolina—which would be cut off from “all hope of equal justice.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1060","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1060","title":"Recreation of Martin Luther King, Jr’s cell in Birmingham, AL, at the National Civil Rights Museum ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_702","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_702","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_703","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_703","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_969","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_969","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_723","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_723","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1063","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1063","title":"Pierce Butler ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_971","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_971","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_972","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_972","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_724","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_724","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide64088","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Avoiding Unjust Laws","thumbnail":"dr/Slide64088_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si64122","si64171","Image_963","Text_Caption_1041","Text_Caption_1060","Image_969","Text_Caption_1063","Image_971","Image_972"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide64088"}}},{"id":"si64209","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si64211","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_325","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_325","title":"A Federal Veto and Prohibitions on State Powers ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_194","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_194","title":"Support for a Federal Veto Declines ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1043","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1043","title":"The pendulum arc of the Convention, which up to then had favored the nationalists, continued to swing back, when on June 15, William Paterson introduced his more federally-framed New Jersey Plan, which of course did not include any federal veto at all. Although his plan would ultimately be rejected, it reopened the question of federal versus national forms of government, which in turn led many members to reconsider some of the more expansive powers given to Congress. \t When John Lansing compared the two plans the following day, June 16, one of his reasons for rejecting the Virginia Plan was: “The states will never feel a sufficient confidence in a general government, to give it a negative on their laws.” A few days later he added: “Will the members of the general legislature be competent judges? Will a gentleman from Georgia be a judge of the expediency of a law which is to operate in New Hampshire?” A week later, Luther Martin of Maryland proclaimed: “the states, particularly the smaller, would never allow a negative to be exercised over their laws.” These objections to the federal veto were issued in the month between the report by the Committee of the Whole and the reconsideration of the provision by the Convention as a whole. Meanwhile, many of them were also feeling the influence of the “Great Compromise,” which split the balance of power in the Congress between the large states and the small states. That “compromise” (which had primarily been viewed as a defeat by the large states) had dampened the enthusiasm of many of their delegates for a stronger national government.

When the federal veto was up for consideration, it was Morris who first responded that he “opposed this power as likely to be terrible to the states, and not necessary if sufficient legislative authority should be given to the general government.” Presumably, Gouverneur Morris was thinking that if Congress were given sufficient legislative authority, they could simply pass laws which would forbid “improper laws” like paper money in the states, and it would therefore be unnecessary to have the additional power of vetoing state laws after they were passed. After thinking it over, Morris “was more and more opposed to the negative.” Roger Sherman likewise thought the power unnecessary, because the courts would not uphold any law that was passed “contravening the authority of the Union.” Vesting such a power in the legislature would therefore be redundant. \t Madison was not satisfied with these alternatives. He countered that challenging objectionable laws in the courts would take too long. States would “pass laws which will accomplish their injurious objects before they can be repealed by the general legislature, or set aside by the national tribunals.” The federal veto was designed to prevent injustice, which was superior to seeking redress after injustices had already taken place. He repeated that the “power of negativing the improper laws of the states is at once the most mild and certain means of preserving the harmony of the system.” Charles Pinckney agreed that it was necessary. This time, however, they were in the decided minority. Even the narrower scope of the federal veto lost, 7 to 3.

In the meantime, on August 23, Charles Pinckney and James Madison again tried to reinstate some version of the federal veto into the Constitution. Pinckney moved that Congress should be empowered to veto state laws “provided that two thirds of the members of each House assent to the same.” By this time, however, the Supremacy Clause had been added, and Roger Sherman therefore believed that the power would be unnecessary. James Wilson “considered this as the key-stone wanted to complete the wide arch of government we are raising.” And at the other end of the spectrum, John Rutledge thought that this provision “alone would damn, and ought to damn, the Constitution. Will any state ever agree to be bound hand and foot in this manner?”  A few delegates argued in its favor, but not enough agreed with them.  \t On August 28, the Convention considered the prohibitions on state powers. Wilson and Sherman immediately sought to strengthen the prohibition on paper money. They wanted to drop the language about the consent of Congress, and instead absolutely forbid the states from these dubious emissions. Sherman “thought this a favorable crisis for crushing paper money.” Most of the Convention agreed, and the change was made with little dissent. Rufus King then proposed that they should add to this list “a prohibition on the States to interfere in private contracts.” Others objected that this would be taking things too far. Numerous laws are passed that inevitably affect private contracts, and an absolute prohibition would prevent the passage of many sound measures. It was then suggested that a prohibition on “retrospective” or ex post facto laws would secure the same result, and that wording was substituted by the Convention, and the language about forbidding the interference of contracts was dropped.

The Convention as a whole, however, did not act on Dickinson’s observation. Instead, once again, a committee took the matter into their own hands. On September 8, a five-member “Committee of Style,” consisting of Johnson, Hamilton, Morris, Madison, and King, was appointed to transform the Convention’s disparate decisions into a final form of the Constitution. The prohibitions on state powers were placed into Article I, Section 10. The Committee retained what had already been adopted—such as forbidding the states from printing money and passing ex post facto laws—but on its own initiative it reinserted the prohibition on “impairing the obligation of contracts.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_712","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_712","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_713","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_713","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1074","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1074","title":"Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1008","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1008","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide64529","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Arriving at a Final Decision","thumbnail":"dr/Slide64529_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si66451","si66453","Text_Caption_1052","Text_Caption_1053","Text_Caption_1074","Image_1008"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide64529"}}},{"id":"si64650","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_330","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_330","title":"A Federal Veto and Prohibitions on State Powers ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_199","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_199","title":"Article 1, Section 10 in Final Form ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1054","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1054","title":"Prohibitions on State Powers in the Constitution ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1055","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1055","title":"When Article I, Section 10, took its final form on September 14, the only objection voiced was that the prohibitions against impairing the obligation of contracts ought to be extended to Congress as well as the state legislatures.

He gave it as his opinion that the Constitution, even if it were adopted, “will neither effectually answer its national object nor prevent the local mischiefs which everywhere excite disgusts against the state governments.” Madison had chiefly in mind the omission of the federal veto. Yet he knew that even his friend had remained skeptical about his idea. Jefferson had previously written that the federal veto “proposes to mend a small hole by covering the whole garment.” Jefferson instead believed that the intervention of a federal judiciary would be sufficient to correct the problems of bad state laws, and that a judicial remedy was not liable to the sorts of abuses that could be expected if Congress were given the power to veto any state law it chose. A month after the Convention, Madison again wrote to Jefferson, and gave his most complete defense yet for the necessity and desirability of the federal veto.

Peck (1810), the Court determined that the one of Georgia’s laws had run afoul of Section 10 when it violated the obligations of contracts; that law was therefore declared null and void.

Section 10, when enforced by the appellate supremacy of the federal judiciary, had prevented all the state abuses that Madison had previously named as examples of injustice: “Paper money, installments of debts, occlusion of Courts, making property a legal tender.” And this remedy had the advantage of creating fewer inroads into the states’ sovereignty over their own laws.

Madison had named what he saw as the most prominent abuses in the list of “Vices” he compiled before the Convention: “Paper money, installments of debts, occlusion of Courts, making property a legal tender.” This list can be broken down into three categories of perceived injustices committed by state legislatures: 1) They changed the value of currency (by issuing “paper money”); 2) they altered the obligation of private contracts (installment laws and making property a legal tender); and 3) after the first two violations had occurred, the states prevented the legal means of redress to the injured party by excluding certain kinds of suits from trial (“occlusion of Courts”). All three of these measures were seen by almost everyone at the Convention as ways to help the borrowing class by cheating the lenders from what was contractually owed to them.  \t In an era when plastic cards have almost supplanted paper money, and the current controversies over currency relate to the use of “bitcoins,” the idea that our Founder Fathers had an almost universal distrust and even loathing of paper currency probably strikes us as quaint, if not bizarre. It may be difficult for us to understand why so many reasonable, well-informed men at this time viewed “paper money” as a bald-faced example of political skullduggery. But from the perspective of 1787, governments had shown themselves to be incompetent (whether through ineptitude, greed, or currying political favor) at controlling the value of currency unless it was issued in the form of precious metals. Under political pressure, it was very tempting to simply print more paper money when more was demanded, undermining its real value. And when the value of money fluctuates, there will always be winners and losers.

The borrower would have followed the letter of the law by paying back the loan, but in fact the lender would have been cheated out of what was rightfully his due. That was why so many people at the time viewed “paper money” as no better than theft by legislation. The state of Rhode Island had been particularly guilty of printing paper money that was not worth its face value, and then passing laws that forced contract-holders to accept the deflated currency in lieu of the payment terms spelled out in their contracts.
