Congress was unable to raise money, because its power to requisition funds relied on compliance from the states; and Congress lacked any power to regulate trade between the states or between the United States and foreign countries. The Virginia Plan had surprised some members with its bold prescriptions for upending the established mode of representation and for transforming the balance of power between state and federal governments. It had the effect of placing what had originally seemed like their main order of business on the back burner for most of the first half of the Convention.

The debates that took place on the subject of taxation were little more than a process of working out the details, and the chief disagreements turned on negotiating the competing interests of the different regions. Everyone understood that taxes on exports would fall more heavily on the Southern States, because this region produced more goods for export. Taxes on imports, at least according to members such as Elbridge Gerry and Gouverneur Morris, would fall more heavily on the Northern States. Even a direct capitation tax (a tax that was proportioned to population) was not immune to regional considerations, since it was decided that for this purpose slaves would be counted at a rate of three-fifths of the free population. Nevertheless, it was generally agreed among the members that a capitation tax would not be the principal means for the new government to raise revenue.

And over the course of the debates, many members in the Southern States refused to consider the possibility of export taxes. Export taxes were finally abandoned, and prohibitions were laid on both the central and the state governments from levying them. \t The first concrete proposal for a scheme of taxation came in the New Jersey Plan, which was offered on June 15. According to this plan, Congress would be empowered to lay import duties on foreign goods and levy a “stamp,” or duty, “on paper, vellum, or parchment.” This clause would have empowered Congress to pass the same sort of “stamp acts” that had enraged the colonists (though they had been enraged not because of the variety of tax, but rather because Great Britain’s Parliament, in which the colonists were not represented, had imposed them).  The New Jersey Plan also provided that Congress could raise money through “postage on all letters or packages passing through the general post-office.” These individual provisions, like the New Jersey Plan as a whole, were never debated. Nonetheless, the next time the Convention was presented with a concrete proposal on taxation, when the Committee of Detail offered its report on August 6, the ideas for raising revenue were remarkably similar.

After trying different formulas, the Framers prescribed a rule for uniformity to follow immediately after the clause empowering Congress to lay such taxes: “but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.” From their debates, it is clear that the Framers understood that there would be an unavoidable disparity in the effects that any particular tax would have on the economies of different states and regions. These sorts of disparities would have to be worked out through the ordinary give-and-take of the political process. But the Framers wanted to be assured that Congress would not lay and collect taxes in a way that explicitly favored one region or state over any other.

Many of the grievances that had sparked the Revolutionary War, after all, related to issues of taxation and trade, and the former colonists were not ready to trust another distant government with the management of these powers. The Confederation Congress had been given the unambiguous power of “regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians, not members of any of the States, provided that the legislative right of any State within its own limits be not infringed or violated.” Yet with regard to trade between the states and between the United States and foreign countries, the Articles had been designed for failure. Congress had been given the exclusive power to make treaties with foreign countries—which would have included commercial treaties—and states were forbidden to “lay any imposts or duties, which may interfere with any stipulations in treaties.” Yet Congress had been given no power to enforce either those treaties or those prohibitions, and there were numerous violations among the states. The Articles had also stipulated that states could not enter into commercial trade agreements with each other without the consent of Congress, and that “the people of each State” would be able to enjoy “all the privileges of trade and commerce” in any other state. Yet, once again, Congress had no authority to enforce these high-minded ideals about free trade and equal treatment among the states, and violations of this principle had been rampant.

Article VII, Section 1 of its report, proposed that: “The legislature of the United States shall have the power … To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states.” No delegate was opposed to the general principle that Congress should possess this power, and the debates on this clause focused on individual exceptions to this broad grant of power. Certain regions, notably in the South, believed that some exceptions were necessary for their economic wellbeing, and two of the exceptions they wanted were already included within the same article in the report of the Committee of Detail. Section 6 stipulated that: “No navigation act shall be passed without the assent of two thirds of the members present in each House.” This protection was added principally at the behest of the Southern States; they worried that navigation acts would typically be passed for the benefit of the Northern States and might harm their trade with foreign nations. The other exception was added at the insistence of South Carolina and Georgia: Section 4 had stated that “the migration or importation of such persons as the several States shall think proper to admit” could not be prohibited. In other words, Congress, when exercising its general grant of power to regulate foreign trade, could not prohibit the slave trade. Eventually, these two provisions were modified in a bargain struck between the Deep South and the Northeastern States (the details of that bargain are described in the section on the slavery compromises).

Madison, on the other hand, admitted that trying to determine which powers would remain with the states depended “on the extent of the power ‘to regulate commerce.’ These terms are vague, but seem to exclude this power of the states.” The more Madison thought about it: “He was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible, and ought to be wholly under one authority.” Sherman agreed that the general government’s power to regulate trade was “supreme,” and therefore Congress could override state regulations whenever they conflicted with federal ones. But the larger question that was raised by this issue—what is the extent of the Congressional power to regulate commerce, especially as it impinges upon the states’ authority to regulate commerce within their own borders?—is a question that became controversial beginning early in the twentieth century.

Ogden vastly expanded the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause (Article 1, Section 8).

Congress could exercise this power in contravention of any conflicting regulation put in force by state governments. Since the Court’s ruling in Gibbons v. Ogden, the Commerce Clause has been used as a justification for sweeping congressional power over many national issues, ranging from trust-busting, aviation, and the drinking age.  The facts of the case are relatively simple: New York had given Aaron Ogden an exclusive license to operate his steamboat ferry on the Hudson River between New Jersey and New York City. Ogden sought an injunction against Thomas Gibbons, another steamboat operator who ran ferries in the same area, citing his exclusive rights granted by the state to operate that ferry route. Gibbons claimed he had the same right pursuant to a 1793 act of Congress regulating coastal commerce. The New York court, not surprisingly found for Ogden and ordered Gibbons to cease operating his ferry. Gibbons appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reviewed the case in 1824, and reversed, finding for Gibbons, and holding New York in violation of the 1793 act of Congress, which took precedence because of the Commerce Clause.
