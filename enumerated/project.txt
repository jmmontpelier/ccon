The sixth resolution proposed, in addition to a federal veto over state laws, “that the national Legislature ought to be impowered to enjoy the Legislative Rights vested in Congress by the Confederation & moreover to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the exercise of individual Legislation.” The wording of this clause ostensibly limited the central government to legislating only in those matters in which the individual states were “incompetent,” but the meaning of that word can be so elastic that many of the Framers feared it could be used to justify almost any power at all that might be claimed by the national legislature. Furthermore, the resolution authorized Congress “to call forth the force of the Union against any member of the Union failing to fulfill its duty under the articles thereof.” And finally, another, separate resolution proposed that the officials of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments in all the states “ought to be bound by oath to support the articles of Union.” These measures, together with the “federal veto,” would have secured a complete supremacy in the national government over state powers. Delegates at the Convention took notice of this, and many were concerned.

They “said they could not well decide how to vote until they should see an exact enumeration of the powers comprehended by this definition.”   Madison decided that he needed to advance some defense for the indefinite language contained in his Virginia Plan. His preference was for a national jurisdiction that was carefully limited and defined, but he also had some doubts whether a system of carefully enumerated powers could ever work. At this early stage in the Convention, “his wishes remained unaltered; but his doubts had become stronger.” He couldn’t tell where their deliberations might lead, but he would “shrink from nothing” that might be necessary to forming a good government.

Instead, as we shall see, there was a tacit understanding among the Framers that they were just not ready to tackle the question of the extent of powers in the new Congress until they had settled some other important questions about how their new government would be constituted. Some delegates were willing to give very broad powers to the central government, but only on condition that the new government divided its powers among the branches of government, and among the individual states, in what they regarded as the best possible way.

The New Jersey Plan reasserted greater state control. From it, gone were the indefinite legislative powers and the federal veto. Instead, the New Jersey Plan gave to the new Congress all “the powers vested in the United States in Congress by the present existing Articles of Confederation,” and then it added a few more. The new Congress would be very much like the old Congress, except that it would have greater powers to raise revenue and it would have more authority to regulate commerce. But the New Jersey Plan added one more feature designed to give heft to the new Congress: A “supremacy clause.” Instead of merely requiring fealty oaths from state officers, the New Jersey Plan stated unequivocally:   That all acts of the United States in Congress, made by virtue and in pursuance of the powers hereby, and by the Articles of Confederation, vested in them, and all treaties made and ratified under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the respective states, so far forth as those acts or treaties shall relate to the said states or their citizens; and that the judiciary of the several states shall be bound thereby in their decisions, any thing in the respective laws of the individual states to the contrary notwithstanding.  Finally, it allowed the federal executive “to call forth the power of the confederated states” in order to “compel an obedience” whenever a state failed to comply with federal directives. The New Jersey Plan therefore spelled out very clearly when the federal government was supreme and how to enforce that supremacy. But the congressional supremacy was very tightly bound to a few enumerated powers.

Not all of the advocates of the New Jersey Plan were from small states: Lansing and Yates from New York and Martin from Maryland were among those leading the charge against the Virginia Plan.  But those delegates who represented small states also had concerns about losing their equal vote in Congress.

It would not, therefore, give to others a power over this happiness, any more than an individual would do, when he could avoid it.” Hugh Williamson of North Carolina seconded that opinion: “The happiness of the people depended on” the state governments. And Oliver Ellsworth developed that theme even further:   What he wanted was domestic happiness. The national government could not descend to the local objects on which this depended. It could only embrace objects of a general nature. He turned his eyes, therefore, for the preservation of his rights, to the state governments. From these alone he could derive the greatest happiness he expects in this life. His happiness depends on their existence, as much as a new-born infant on its mother for nourishment.  A strong central government might be necessary for grand objects like national defense or commerce with foreign nations and between states. But as for those little matters upon which so much of human happiness depended—the preservation of domestic peace and harmony, the protection of individual rights—these were matters that were best handled locally. Domestic policy should be determined by politicians who had a close connection to those constituents whose lives would be most affected by the laws they passed.

And there was good reason why some of the delegates from the larger states were beginning to have misgivings. Edmund Randolph admitted at the end of their deliberations on July 16 that “the vote of this morning”—which had given the states an equal vote in the Senate—“had embarrassed the business extremely.” Many delegates from the large states had been willing to give great powers to the central government only on condition that the states would be represented proportionally in both branches of the legislature. Now that it was clear that they had lost on that issue, some of these delegates were having second thoughts about a Congress with indefinite powers.

The Committee of Detail which met between July 27 and August 6—the same one that had inserted, on its own initiative, certain prohibitions on state powers—decided also to enumerate the powers that should be granted to Congress. This unilateral decision was all the more surprising since a motion to commit this question had already lost among the delegates only a couple of weeks earlier. Nonetheless, there must have been a tacit expectation among the delegates that this committee would attempt to specify and enumerate congressional powers, because no one at the Convention objected to this assertive insertion, and no one tried to reassert the broad indefinite powers under which they had been operating throughout that summer. Over the remaining weeks, specific powers would be added, changed, or removed from the Committee’s original enumeration, but no one tried to undo the enumeration itself. \t The Committee of Detail did something else that was noteworthy. After naming more than a dozen powers that would be granted to Congress, the enumeration concluded by specifying that the legislature shall have the power “to make all laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof.” The Necessary and Proper Clause would later become enormously controversial. Antifederalists seized upon this clause as proof that the federal government was really under no restraints at all. In the Virginia Ratifying Convention, opponents to the Constitution called it the “sweeping clause,” because they claimed it would sweep all powers before it. And in the first years after the Constitution was ratified, disagreements over how to interpret this clause would be a major cause of the split into a two-party system.

By comparison, this additional grant of power—to exercise only those powers “necessary and proper” for exercising its enumerated powers—must have seemed to the Framers like a very modest and logical extension. By the end of the Convention, however, the dissenting Framers, at least, began to have misgivings. Edmund Randolph protested against “the indefinite and dangerous power given by the Constitution to Congress.” And Elbridge Gerry claimed that one of his most insuperable objections to the Constitution was “the general power of the legislature to make what laws they may please to call ‘necessary and proper.’” Not everyone at the Convention would have agreed that this clause was meant to be such a broad grant of power, but history has shown that the breadth of this clause would depend very much on how it was interpreted.

It is probably safe to say that no one going into the Convention had a clear idea of what variety of federalism they would have when they came out.

Congressional powers were enumerated, but they were broader and more potent than those given to the Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and they were broadened even further by a Necessary and Proper Clause. The federal government was further strengthened, at least on paper, by a Supremacy Clause and a requirement that state officials swear oaths to support the Constitution.

It specified that taxes would be raised “to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.” Similarly, in the last week of the Convention, the Committee of Style drafted a preamble for the Constitution which listed among the purposes for the Union: “to promote the general welfare.” Antifederalists would later claim that this phrase, “general welfare,” was so broad that it undid all of the restraining effects of the enumerated powers. Federalists replied that the phrase was no additional grant of power; in fact, it further restrained it. The “welfare” part of the phrase simply referred to the enumerated powers that followed, and the “general” part specified that funds could only be appropriated for national, rather than local, purposes.

The phrase was not proposed as an addition to the Constitution until July 17. Roger Sherman (who consistently sought to limit federal powers throughout the Convention) objected to the indefinite powers given to Congress in the Virginia Plan. He proposed instead to insert language that empowered Congress to legislate “in all cases which may concern the common interests,” or the “general welfare,” of the union, “but not to interfere with the government of the individual states in any matters of internal police which respect the government of such states only.” He followed this proposal with another proposal to enumerate the powers of Congress. So the phrase was initially introduced as a way of limiting congressional powers to exclude interference in local or state matters. But both of Sherman’s proposals failed that day. ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1092","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1092","title":"On August 25, Sherman again suggested the phrase, this time for a different reason. He thought they needed “an express provision for the object of the old debts, &c.,” and therefore he moved to add a clause to the section empowering Congress to lay taxes. The clause would specify that these taxes were “for the payment of said debts, and for the defraying the expenses that shall be incurred for the common defence and general welfare.” The motion was soundly defeated, but only because the rest of the Convention thought the clause unnecessary. In other words, no one at the Convention (beyond some members from Connecticut) believed that this clause added anything to the meaning of that section which already enumerated the powers of Congress. But the Committee of Eleven which met in early September (and of which Sherman was a member) discreetly added a clause that was almost identical to the one that Sherman had unsuccessfully proposed a week earlier.  \t  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_724","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_724","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_725","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_725","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide65916","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"EC -
