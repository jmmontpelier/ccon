a public opinion poll were taken which asked average Americans to name a favorite part of the 1787 Constitution (taking the Bill of Rights out of the running), most people would probably choose the Preamble.  Its simple and direct phrases do not match the soaring rhetoric found in the Declaration of Independence (“When in the course of human events …”) nor do they make the same lofty and universal claims (“all men are created equal”).  Nonetheless, it is the closest thing in our Constitution to a statement of principle.  If the rest of the Constitution is our government’s instruction manual, then the Preamble is the mission statement for the country.  Yet little can be known about how it was drafted or why it was adopted.  The paragraph that we recognize as the Preamble was written in the Committee of Style very late in the Convention, and it was adopted by the Convention without any debate and even, it would appear, without a formal vote.  It is impossible to glean from the process of framing the Preamble, then, what the Framers might have intended by this short paragraph.   \t In a broader sense, the entire proceedings of the summer were a debate over the Preamble.  It was within these debates that the Framers established and clarified their aims for the new Constitution, and the Preamble merely expressed, in the final hours of their labors, those aims which they had already presupposed throughout all of their other decisions.  Not all of these aims had arisen de novo from the Convention debates, however.  Some of them had already been expressed in the Articles of Confederation.  Indeed, the delegates’ first serious discussion in the Convention was an exploration of how to achieve those goals that the Articles had declared for itself but which it had been unable to fulfill.

On the following day, Randolph and Morris moved to postpone the first resolution to take up three replacements.  The first of these three propositions was similar to the first resolution:  “That a union of the states merely federal will not accomplish the objects proposed by the Articles of Confederation—namely, common defence, security of liberty, and general welfare”.  But the delegates’ attention was fixated on the other two propositions, which related to the nature of  the government they were about to create—whether it should be national or federal and which government should be supreme—and therefore the more abstract question of identifying the aims of this government was dropped and not addressed again directly.

The committee mainly followed the example of the Articles of Confederation, but they altered some words in small but significant ways.  The Articles had spoken on behalf of the members of Congress and stated their intention to “agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union between the States of …” before enumerating all thirteen states by name.  The committee’s preamble, on the other hand, had shifted the voice:  “We, the people of the states of … [naming all thirteen states], do ordain, declare, and establish, the following Constitution for the government of our selves and our posterity.”  Both documents listed all of the states individually, but only the emerging constitution spoke for the people of those states, proclaiming that they would be the ones doing the ordaining and establishing of this Constitution.  They had also changed “confederacy” to “government,” making no secret of their decision to shift from a simple confederacy to a government.  The Convention unanimously agreed to this preamble on August 7 without any debate.  The Committee of Style, appointed in September, was the second group to take up the drafting of the Preamble. Morris takes credit for drafting most of the final version of the Constitution, and its Preamble may have come from his pen.  The Preamble that the committee drafted was adopted almost without change into the Constitution; the only difference between the two is that the Framers chose to strike the word “to” from the clause “establish justice.”  Other than that vote, which is recorded in the Journal (but not in Madison’s notes) on September 13, the records disclose no instance of the delegates deliberating about the Preamble during the whole of the Convention.

With the opening and closing words of the Preamble, the Framers announced that they were proposing a new kind of compact, different from the one that they were trying to replace:  “We the People of the United States … do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”  Those opening words were the only part of the Preamble that would become controversial during the ratifying debates.  In the Virginia Ratifying Convention, Patrick Henry asked of the Framers, “What right had they to say, We, the people? …  Who authorized them to speak the language of, We, the people, instead of, We, the states?”  The answer to that question, of course, was found within the body of the Constitution.  The Framers of the Constitution had no authority to speak for the people, but the people had the authority to speak for themselves.  And by submitting the proposed Constitution to the people, through the medium of ratification conventions which were popularly elected, the people were being given a genuine alternative to “ordain and establish this Constitution” or to reject it.  If they rejected it, then the Constitution would be no more than a historical artifact, but if they accepted it, then the language of “We the People” would be fully justified.

The older compact had promised in its Preamble to establish a “perpetual Union between the States,” and that promise had lasted only a few years.  The new Preamble had promised instead “to form a more perfect Union.”  This language is sometimes mocked as ungrammatical, because it cannot be said of two perfect things that one is more perfect than the other.  But of course that is not the sense in which the words were constructed.  None of the Framers believed that either compact was perfect, but they believed that the union that the Constitution created was closer to perfection than the one that had existed under the Articles. This union would be “more perfect” than the old one because it would be founded on the consent of the people and it would operate directly on the people (the Articles of Confederation had been created by and for the states).  The body of the Constitution fulfilled this promise by its popular ratification, its popular representation in Congress, and by establishing an executive branch that was empowered to execute the federal laws directly, rather than going through the states as intermediaries.

There were particular provisions added to the Constitution that were designed to establish justice in ways that the Articles never could.  The establishment of a judicial branch comes immediately to mind, along with some of its attendant features, like a trial by jury.  There are also some explicit prohibitions in the Constitution that are meant to establish justice by guarding against injustice.  Congress is forbidden from suspending the writ of habeas corpus, except under dire circumstances, or from passing any ex post facto laws. And the states are forbidden from printing paper money or impairing the obligation of contracts.  But even more important than these individual constitutional prohibitions, the structure of the government was itself meant to achieve a more perfect justice than the Articles had done.  The new legislature was constructed using a more just measure of apportionment; therefore, many of the delegates expected that the laws proceeding from this new body would be a more accurate and just representation of the people who comprised the union.

And there were some provisions for establishing comity between the states that are found in both compacts (such as the “privileges and immunities” and “full faith and credit” clauses).  But after the experience of Shays’ Rebellion in Massachusetts, the Framers had come to believe that the old compact was insufficient in this regard.  The new Constitution therefore aimed for something more than friendship between sovereign states; it also sought to ensure domestic tranquility within the states.  To that end, Article I gave to Congress the power of “calling forth the Militia to … suppress Insurrections.”  And Article IV likewise made this promise:  The United States would protect the states “against domestic Violence” whenever the states asked for help.  The new promise of “domestic Tranquility” therefore related to maintaining the peace within the states as well as between them.

The new institution of a vigorous executive, one who could act as commander in chief when necessary, would provide for the common defense far more efficiently than the old plan of entrusting intricate military decisions to a numerous body such as Congress.  In addition, the new Congress, unlike the old one, was empowered to establish a standing army.  And the general welfare would be better promoted in two ways.  First, the improved system of representation would ensure that the welfare they sought would be more “general” and less regional.  Second, some of the added powers of Congress, particularly as they related to trade, would allow the legislative body to make good on its promise of looking out for the people’s welfare.

The Constitution was meant to “secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.”  The Articles had only looked to the liberties of the states; the Constitution sought to secure liberty for the people of the United States, both at the present time and far into the future.  And whereas the Articles had been content with guarding liberty alone, the Constitution sought to safeguard all the blessings that come with liberty.  The Constitution promoted liberty and its blessings, in part, because of the new checks that were being instituted—both between the branches of the federal government and between the layers of government at the state and federal level.  Liberty was further promoted in the Constitution’s Article IV guarantee to the states of “a republican form of government.”  Here, the Constitution was explicitly looking to the future.  The states all had republican governments at the time the Constitution was being written and ratified, and the people of the states could enjoy the blessings of that liberty.  But this guarantee in the Constitution ensured that the nation’s posterity could never be denied that blessing.  The Constitution’s Preamble therefore made grander promises than the ones found in the Articles of Confederation, but the more important difference was that the new Constitution had been designed to keep its promises.

A document survives in Edmund Randolph’s handwriting describing some thoughts on constitutional preambles:  A preamble seems proper.  Not for the purpose of designating the ends of government and human polities—This display of theory, howsoever proper in the first formation of state governments, is unfit here; since we are not working on the natural rights of men not yet gathered into society, but upon those rights, modified by society, and interwoven with what we call the rights of states—Nor yet is it proper for the purpose of mutually pledging the faith of the parties for the observance of the articles—This may be done more solemnly at the close of the draught, as in the confederation—But the object of our preamble ought to be briefly to declare, that the present federal government is insufficient to the general happiness; that the conviction of this fact gave birth to this convention; and that the only effectual mode which they can devise, for curing this insufficiency, is the establishment of a supreme legislative executive and judiciary—Let it be next declared, that the following are the constitution and fundamentals of government for the United States–  The preamble that the committee drafted was even more minimalist than the aims stated in this proposal.  But these thoughts seem to reflect the Convention’s final decision to adopt a preamble that deliberately departed from those declarations of abstract principles that were often found in some of the state constitutions.
